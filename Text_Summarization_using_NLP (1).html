/*
The following CSS variables define the main, public API for styling JupyterLab.
These variables should be used by all plugins wherever possible. In other
words, plugins should not define custom colors, sizes, etc unless absolutely
necessary. This enables users to change the visual theme of JupyterLab
by changing these variables.

Many variables appear in an ordered sequence (0,1,2,3). These sequences
are designed to work well together, so for example, `--jp-border-color1` should
be used with `--jp-layout-color1`. The numbers have the following meanings:

* 0: super-primary, reserved for special emphasis
* 1: primary, most important under normal situations
* 2: secondary, next most important under normal situations
* 3: tertiary, next most important under normal situations

Throughout JupyterLab, we are mostly following principles from Google's
Material Design when selecting colors. We are not, however, following
all of MD as it is not optimized for dense, information rich UIs.

ABOUT THE PUBLISHER  
 
  
TEN YEARS ON  
 
 
I REMEMBER RECEIVING A LETTER  FROM THE  AMERICAN  publisher Harper 
Collins that said that: “reading The Alchemist  was like getting up at 
dawn and seeing the sun rise while the rest of the world still slept.” I 
went outside, looked up at the sky, and thought to myself: “So, the 
book is g oing to be published in English!” At the time, I was 
struggling to establish myself as a writer and to follow my path 
despite all the voices telling me it was impossible.  
And little by little, my dream was becoming reality. Ten, a 
hundred, a thousand, a million copies sold in America. One day, a 
Brazilian journalist phoned to say that President Clinton had been 
photographed reading the book. Some time later, when I was in 
Turkey, I opened the magazine Vanity Fair  and there was Julia 
Roberts declaring that she adored the book. Walking alone down a 
street in Miami, I heard a girl telling her mother: “You must read 
The Alchemist !” 
The book has been translated into fifty -six languages, has sold 
more than twenty million copies, and people are beginning to ask: 
What’s the secret behind such a huge success?  
The only honest response is: I don’t know. All I know is that, like 
Santiago the shepherd boy, we all need to be aware of ou r personal 
calling. What is a personal calling? It is God’s blessing, it is the path 
that God chose for you here on Earth. Whenever we do something 
that fills us with enthusiasm, we are following our legend. However, 
we don’t all have the courage to confro nt our own dream.  Why?  
There are four obstacles. First: we are told from childhood 
onward that everything we want to do is impossible. We grow up 
with this idea, and as the years accumulate, so too do the layers of 
prejudice, fear, and guilt. There comes a  time when our personal 
calling is so deeply buried in our soul as to be invisible. But it’s still 
there.  
If we have the courage to disinter dream, we are then faced by 
the second obstacle: love. We know what we want to do, but are 
afraid of hurting those around us by abandoning everything in 
order to pursue our dream. We do not realize that love is just a 
further impetus, not something that will prevent us going forward. 
We do not realize that those who genuinely wish us well want us to 
be happy and are pr epared to accompany us on that journey.  
Once we have accepted that love is a stimulus, we come up 
against the third obstacle: fear of the defeats we will meet on the 
path. We who fight for our dream, suffer far more when it doesn’t 
work out, because we can not fall back on the old excuse: “Oh, well, I 
didn’t really want it anyway.” We do want it and know that we have 
staked everything on it and that the path of the personal calling is 
no easier than any other path, except that our whole heart is in this 
jour ney. Then, we warriors of light must be prepared to have 
patience in difficult times and to know that the Universe is 
conspiring in our favor, even though we may not understand how.  
I ask myself: are defeats necessary?  
Well, necessary or not, they happen. When we first begin 
fighting for our dream, we have no experience and make many 
mistakes. The secret of life, though, is to fall seven times and to get 
up eight times.  So, why is it so important to live our personal calling if we are 
only going to suffer m ore than other people?  
Because, once we have overcome the defeats —and we always 
do—we are filled by a greater sense of euphoria and confidence. In 
the silence of our hearts, we know that we are proving ourselves 
worthy of the miracle of life. Each day, eac h hour, is part of the good 
fight. We start to live with enthusiasm and pleasure. Intense, 
unexpected suffering passes more quickly than suffering that is 
apparently bearable; the latter goes on for years and, without our 
noticing, eats away at our soul, u ntil, one day, we are no longer able 
to free ourselves from the bitterness and it stays with us for the rest 
of our lives.  
Having disinterred our dream, having used the power of love to 
nurture it and spent many years living with the scars, we suddenly 
notice that what we always wanted is there, waiting for us, perhaps 
the very next day. Then comes the fourth obstacle: the fear of 
realizing the dream for which we fought all our lives.  
Oscar Wilde said: “Each man kills the thing he loves.” And it’s 
true. The  mere possibility of getting what we want fills the soul of 
the ordinary person with guilt. We look around at all those who 
have failed to get what they want and feel that we do not deserve to 
get what we want either. We forget about all the obstacles we 
overcame, all the suffering we endured, all the things we had to give 
up in order to get this far. I have known a lot of people who, when 
their personal calling was within their grasp, went on to commit a 
series of stupid mistakes and never reached their go al—when it was 
only a step away.  
This is the most dangerous of the obstacles because it has a kind 
of saintly aura about it: renouncing joy and conquest. But if you 
believe yourself worthy of the thing you fought so hard to get, then you become an instrume nt of God, you help the Soul of the World, 
and you understand why you are here.

THE ALCHEMIST PICKED UP A BOOK THAT SOMEONE IN THE  caravan had 
brought. Leafing through the pages, he found a story about 
Narcissus.  
The alchemist knew the legend of Narcissus, a youth who knelt 
daily beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty. He was so 
fascinated by himself that, one morning, he fell into the lake and 
drowned. At the spot where he fell, a flower was born, which was 
called the narcissus.  
But this was not how the author of the book ended the story.  
He said that wh en Narcissus died, the goddesses of the forest 
appeared and found the lake, which had been fresh water, 
transformed into a lake of salty tears.  
“Why do you weep?” the goddesses asked.  
“I weep for Narcissus,” the lake replied.  
“Ah, it is no surprise that yo u weep for Narcissus,” they said, “for 
though we always pursued him in the forest, you alone could 
contemplate his beauty close at hand.”  
“But…was Narcissus beautiful?” the lake asked.  
“Who better than you to know that?” the goddesses said in 
wonder. “Afte r all, it was by your banks that he knelt each day to 
contemplate himself!”  The lake was silent for some time. Finally, it said:  
“I weep for Narcissus, but I never noticed that Narcissus was 
beautiful. I weep because, each time he knelt beside my banks, I 
could see, in the depths of his eyes, my own beauty reflected.”  
“What a lovely story,” the alchemist thought.  
  
PART ONE  
 
 
  
 
 
 
THE BOY’S NAME WAS  SANTIAGO . D USK WAS FALLING AS  the boy arrived 
with his herd at an abandoned church. The roof had fallen in long 
ago, and an enormous sycamore had grown on the spot where the 
sacristy had once stood.  
He decided to spend the night there. He saw to it that all the 
sheep entered through the ru ined gate, and then laid some planks 
across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night. 
There were no wolves in the region, but once an animal had strayed 
during the night, and the boy had had to spend the entire next day 
searching for it . 
He swept the floor with his jacket and lay down, using the book 
he had just finished reading as a pillow. He told himself that he 
would have to start reading thicker books: they lasted longer, and 
made more comfortable pillows.  
It was still dark when he awoke, and, looking up, he could see 
the stars through the half -destroyed roof.  
I wanted to sleep a little longer, he thought. He had had the same 
dream that night as a week ago, and once again he had awakened 
before it ended.  
He arose and, taking up his c rook, began to awaken the sheep 
that still slept. He had noticed that, as soon as he awoke, most of his 
animals also began to stir. It was as if some mysterious energy 
bound his life to that of the sheep, with whom he had spent the past 
two years, leading them through the countryside in search of food 
and water. “They are so used to me that they know my schedule,” he 
muttered. Thinking about that for a moment, he realized that it could be the other way around: that it was he who had become 
accustomed to their schedule.  
But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken. 
The boy prodded them, one by one, with his crook, calling each by 
name. He had always believed that the sheep were able to 
understand what he said. So there were times when he rea d them 
parts of his books that had made an impression on him, or when he 
would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in 
the fields. Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he 
had seen in the villages they passed.  
But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one 
thing: the girl, the daughter of a merchant who lived in the village 
they would reach in about four days. He had been to the village only 
once, the year before. The merchant was the proprietor of a dry 
goods shop, and he always demanded that the sheep be sheared in 
his presence, so that he would not be cheated. A friend had told the 
boy about the shop, and he had taken his sheep there.  
 
 
 
“I NEED TO SELL SOME WOOL,” THE BOY TOLD THE  merchant.  
The shop was busy, and the man asked the shepherd to wait 
until the afternoon. So the boy sat on the steps of the shop and took 
a book from his bag.  
“I didn’t know shepherds knew how to read,” said a girl’s voice 
behind him.  
The girl was typical of the region of Andalu sia, with flowing 
black hair, and eyes that vaguely recalled the Moorish conquerors.  
“Well, usually I learn more from my sheep than from books,” he 
answered. During the two hours that they talked, she told him she was the merchant’s daughter, and spoke of life in the village, where 
each day was like all the others. The shepherd told her of the 
Andalusian countryside, and related the news from the other towns 
where he had stopped. It was a pleasant change from talking to his 
sheep.  
“How did you learn to read ?” the girl asked at one point.  
“Like everybody learns,” he said. “In school.”  
“Well, if you know how to read, why are you just a shepherd?”  
The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid 
responding to her question. He was sure the girl would never 
understand. He went on telling stories about his travels, and her 
bright, Moorish eyes went wide with fear and surprise. As the time 
passed, the boy found himself wishing that the day would never 
end, that her father would stay busy and keep him waiting for three 
days. He recognized that he was feeling something he had never 
experienced before: the desire to live in one place forever. With the 
girl with the raven hair, his days would never be the same again.  
But finally the merchant appeared, and asked the bo y to shear 
four sheep. He paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come 
back the following year.  
 
 
 
AND NOW IT WAS ONLY FOUR DAYS BEFORE HE WOULD BE  back in that same 
village. He was excited, and at the same time uneasy: maybe the girl 
had already forgo tten him. Lots of shepherds passed through, 
selling their wool.  
“It doesn’t matter,” he said to his sheep. “I know other girls in 
other places.”  But in his heart he knew that it did matter. And he knew that 
shepherds, like seamen and like traveling salesme n, always found a 
town where there was someone who could make them forget the 
joys of carefree wandering.  
The day was dawning, and the shepherd urged his sheep in the 
direction of the sun. They never have to make any decisions, he 
thought. Maybe that’s why  they always stay close to me.  
The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water. 
As long as the boy knew how to find the best pastures in Andalusia, 
they would be his friends. Yes, their days were all the same, with the 
seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk; and they had 
never read a book in their young lives, and didn’t understand when 
the boy told them about the sights of the cities. They were content 
with just food and water, and, in exchange, they generously gave of 
their wool, th eir company, and —once in a while —their meat.  
If I became a monster today, and decided to kill them, one by 
one, they would become aware only after most of the flock had been 
slaughtered, thought the boy. They trust me, and they’ve forgotten 
how to rely on their own instincts, because I lead them to 
nourishment.  
The boy was surprised at his thoughts. Maybe the church, with 
the sycamore growing from within, had been haunted. It had caused 
him to have the same dream for a second time, and it was causing 
him to  feel anger toward his faithful companions. He drank a bit 
from the wine that remained from his dinner of the night before, 
and he gathered his jacket closer to his body. He knew that a few 
hours from now, with the sun at its zenith, the heat would be so 
great that he would not be able to lead his flock across the fields. It 
was the time of day when all of Spain slept during the summer. The 
heat lasted until nightfall, and all that time he had to carry his jacket. But when he thought to complain about the b urden of its 
weight, he remembered that, because he had the jacket, he had 
withstood the cold of the dawn.  
We have to be prepared for change, he thought, and he was 
grateful for the jacket’s weight and warmth.  
The jacket had a purpose, and so did the boy. His purpose in life 
was to travel, and, after two years of walking the Andalusian terrain, 
he knew all the cities of the region. He was planning, on this visit, to 
explain to the girl how it was that a simple shepherd knew how to 
read. That he had attended  a seminary until he was sixteen. His 
parents had wanted him to become a priest, and thereby a source of 
pride for a simple farm family. They worked hard just to have food 
and water, like the sheep. He had studied Latin, Spanish, and 
theology. But ever sin ce he had been a child, he had wanted to know 
the world, and this was much more important to him than knowing 
God and learning about man’s sins. One afternoon, on a visit to his 
family, he had summoned up the courage to tell his father that he 
didn’t want to become a priest. That he wanted to travel.  
 
 
 
“PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD HAVE PASSED  through this village, 
son,” said his father. “They come in search of new things, but when 
they leave they are basically the same people they were when they 
arrived. They climb the mountain to see the castle, and they wind up 
thinking that the past was bet ter than what we have now. They have 
blond hair, or dark skin, but basically they’re the same as the people 
who live right here.”  
“But I’d like to see the castles in the towns where they live,” the 
boy explained.  “Those people, when they see our land, say that they would like 
to live here forever,” his father continued.  
“Well, I’d like to see their land, and see how they live,” said his 
son.  
“The people who come here have a lot of money to spend, so 
they can afford to travel,” his father said. “Amongst us, the only ones 
who travel are the shepherds.”  
“Well, then I’ll be a shepherd!”  
His father said no more. The next day, he gave his son a pouch 
that held three ancient Spanish gold coins.  
“I found these one day in the fields. I wanted them to be a part of 
your inheritance. But use them to buy your flock. Take to the fields, 
and someday you’ll learn that our countryside is the best, and our 
women are the most beautiful.”  
And he gave the boy his blessing. The boy could see in his 
father’s gaze a desire to be abl e, himself, to travel the world —a 
desire that was still alive, despite his father’s having had to bury it, 
over dozens of years, under the burden of struggling for water to 
drink, food to eat, and the same place to sleep every night of his life.  
 
 
 
THE HOR IZON WAS TINGED WITH RED, AND SUDDENLY THE  sun appeared. 
The boy thought back to that conversation with his father, and felt 
happy; he had already seen many castles and met many women (but 
none the equal of the one who awaited him several days hence). He 
owned a jacket, a book that he could trade for another, and a flock of 
sheep. But, most important, he was able every day to live out his 
dream. If he were to tire of the Andalusian fields, he could sell his 
sheep and go to sea. By the time he had had enough  of the sea, he would already have known other cities, other women, and other 
chances to be happy. I couldn’t have found God in the seminary, he 
thought, as he looked at the sunrise.  
Whenever he could, he sought out a new road to travel. He had 
never been to that ruined church before, in spite of having traveled 
through those parts many times. The world was huge and 
inexhaustible; he had only to allow his sheep to set the route for a 
while, and he would discover other interesting things. The problem 
is that  they don’t even realize that they’re walking a new road every 
day. They don’t see that the fields are new and the seasons change. 
All they think about is food and water.  
Maybe we’re all that way, the boy mused. Even me —I haven’t 
thought of other women sin ce I met the merchant’s daughter. 
Looking at the sun, he calculated that he would reach Tarifa before 
midday. There, he could exchange his book for a thicker one, fill his 
wine bottle, shave, and have a haircut; he had to prepare himself for 
his meeting wi th the girl, and he didn’t want to think about the 
possibility that some other shepherd, with a larger flock of sheep, 
had arrived there before him and asked for her hand.  
It’s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life 
interesting, he tho ught, as he looked again at the position of the sun, 
and hurried his pace. He had suddenly remembered that, in Tarifa, 
there was an old woman who interpreted dreams.  
 
 
 
THE OLD WOMAN LED THE BOY TO A ROOM AT THE BACK  of her house; it was 
separated from her  living room by a curtain of colored beads. The 
room’s furnishings consisted of a table, an image of the Sacred Heart 
of Jesus, and two chairs.  The woman sat down, and told him to be seated as well. Then 
she took both of his hands in hers, and began quietl y to pray.  
It sounded like a Gypsy prayer. The boy had already had 
experience on the road with Gypsies; they also traveled, but they 
had no flocks of sheep. People said that Gypsies spent their lives 
tricking others. It was also said that they had a pact w ith the devil, 
and that they kidnapped children and, taking them away to their 
mysterious camps, made them their slaves. As a child, the boy had 
always been frightened to death that he would be captured by 
Gypsies, and this childhood fear returned when the  old woman took 
his hands in hers.  
But she has the Sacred Heart of Jesus there, he thought, trying to 
reassure himself. He didn’t want his hand to begin trembling, 
showing the old woman that he was fearful. He recited an Our 
Father silently.  
“Very interest ing,” said the woman, never taking her eyes from 
the boy’s hands, and then she fell silent.  
The boy was becoming nervous. His hands began to tremble, and 
the woman sensed it. He quickly pulled his hands away.  
“I didn’t come here to have you read my palm,” he said, already 
regretting having come. He thought for a moment that it would be 
better to pay her fee and leave without learning a thing, that he was 
giving too much importance to his recurrent dream.  
“You came so that you could learn about your dreams,”  said the 
old woman. “And dreams are the language of God. When he speaks 
in our language, I can interpret what he has said. But if he speaks in 
the language of the soul, it is only you who can understand. But, 
whichever it is, I’m going to charge you for t he consultation.”  Another trick, the boy thought. But he decided to take a chance. 
A shepherd always takes his chances with wolves and with drought, 
and that’s what makes a shepherd’s life exciting.  
“I have had the same dream twice,” he said. “I dreamed that I 
was in a field with my sheep, when a child appeared and began to 
play with the animals. I don’t like people to do that, because the 
sheep are afraid of strangers. But children always seem to be able to 
play with them without frightening them. I don’ t know why. I don’t 
know how animals know the age of human beings.”  
“Tell me more about your dream,” said the woman. “I have to get 
back to my cooking, and, since you don’t have much money, I can’t 
give you a lot of time.”  
“The child went on playing with my sheep for quite a while,” 
continued the boy, a bit upset. “And suddenly, the child took me by 
both hands and transported me to the Egyptian pyramids.”  
He paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the 
Egyptian pyramids were. But she said nothing.  
“Then, at the Egyptian pyramids,” —he said the last three words 
slowly, so that the old woman would understand —“the child said to 
me, ‘If you come here, you will find a hidden treasure.’ And, just as 
she was about to show me the exact location, I woke up. Both 
times.”  
The woman was silent for some time. Then she again took his 
hands and studied them carefully.  
“I’m not going to charge you anything now,” she said. “But I want 
one-tenth of the treasure, if you find it.”  
The boy laughed —out of happiness. He wa s going to be able to 
save the little money he had because of a dream about hidden 
treasure!  
“Well, interpret the dream,” he said.  “First, swear to me. Swear that you will give me one -tenth of 
your treasure in exchange for what I am going to tell you.”  
The shepherd swore that he would. The old woman asked him to 
swear again while looking at the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.  
“It’s a dream in the language of the world,” she said. “I can 
interpret it, but the interpretation is very difficult. That’s why I feel 
that I deserve a part of what you find.  
“And this is my interpretation: you must go to the Pyramids in 
Egypt. I have never heard of them, but, if it was a child who showed 
them to you, they exist. There you will find a treasure that will make 
you a rich man.”  
The boy was surprised, and then irritated. He didn’t need to seek 
out the old woman for this! But then he remembered that he wasn’t 
going to have to pay anything.  
“I didn’t need to waste my time just for this,” he said.  
“I told you that your dre am was a difficult one. It’s the simple 
things in life that are the most extraordinary; only wise men are 
able to understand them. And since I am not wise, I have had to 
learn other arts, such as the reading of palms.”  
“Well, how am I going to get to Egypt ?” 
“I only interpret dreams. I don’t know how to turn them into 
reality. That’s why I have to live off what my daughters provide me 
with.”  
“And what if I never get to Egypt?”  
“Then I don’t get paid. It wouldn’t be the first time.”  
And the woman told the bo y to leave, saying she had already 
wasted too much time with him.  
So the boy was disappointed; he decided that he would never 
again believe in dreams. He remembered that he had a number of 
things he had to take care of: he went to the market for something to eat, he traded his book for one that was thicker, and he found a 
bench in the plaza where he could sample the new wine he had 
bought. The day was hot, and the wine was refreshing. The sheep 
were at the gates of the city, in a stable that belonged to a f riend. 
The boy knew a lot of people in the city. That was what made 
traveling appeal to him —he always made new friends, and he didn’t 
need to spend all of his time with them. When someone sees the 
same people every day, as had happened with him at the semi nary, 
they wind up becoming a part of that person’s life. And then they 
want the person to change. If someone isn’t what others want them 
to be, the others become angry. Everyone seems to have a clear idea 
of how other people should lead their lives, but n one about his or 
her own.  
He decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky 
before following his flock back through the fields. Three days from 
now, he would be with the merchant’s daughter.  
He started to read the book he had bought. On the very first page 
it described a burial ceremony. And the names of the people 
involved were very difficult to pronounce. If he ever wrote a book, 
he thought, he would present one person at a time, so that the 
reader wouldn’t have to worry about memorizing a lot of names.  
When he was finally able to concentrate on what he was reading, 
he liked the book better; the burial was on a snowy day, and he 
welcomed the feeling of being cold. As he read on, an old man sat 
down at his side and tried to strike up a conver sation.  
“What are they doing?” the old man asked, pointing at the people 
in the plaza.  
“Working,” the boy answered dryly, making it look as if he 
wanted to concentrate on his reading.  Actually, he was thinking about shearing his sheep in front of the 
merch ant’s daughter, so that she could see that he was someone 
who was capable of doing difficult things. He had already imagined 
the scene many times; every time, the girl became fascinated when 
he explained that the sheep had to be sheared from back to front.  He 
also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared 
the sheep. Most of them he had read in books, but he would tell 
them as if they were from his personal experience. She would never 
know the difference, because she didn’t know how to read . 
Meanwhile, the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a 
conversation. He said that he was tired and thirsty, and asked if he 
might have a sip of the boy’s wine. The boy offered his bottle, 
hoping that the old man would leave him alone.  
But the old  man wanted to talk, and he asked the boy what book 
he was reading. The boy was tempted to be rude, and move to 
another bench, but his father had taught him to be respectful of the 
elderly. So he held out the book to the man —for two reasons: first, 
that he , himself, wasn’t sure how to pronounce the title; and second, 
that if the old man didn’t know how to read, he would probably feel 
ashamed and decide of his own accord to change benches.  
“Hmm…” said the old man, looking at all sides of the book, as if it 
were some strange object. “This is an important book, but it’s really 
irritating.”  
The boy was shocked. The old man knew how to read, and had 
already read the book. And if the book was irritating, as the old man 
had said, the boy still had time to change it  for another.  
“It’s a book that says the same thing almost all the other books in 
the world say,” continued the old man. “It describes people’s 
inability to choose their own Personal Legends. And it ends up 
saying that everyone believes the world’s greates t lie.”  “What’s the world’s greatest lie?” the boy asked, completely 
surprised.  
“It’s this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of 
what’s happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. 
That’s the world’s greatest lie.”  
“That’s never happened to me,” the boy said. “They wanted me 
to be a priest, but I decided to become a shepherd.”  
“Much better,” said the old man. “Because you really like to 
travel.”  
“He knew what I was thinking,” the boy said to himself. The old 
man, meanwhile, was leafing through the book, without seeming to 
want to return it at all. The boy noticed that the man’s clothing was 
strange. He looked like an Arab, which was not unusual in those 
parts. Africa was only a few hours from Tarifa; one had only to cross 
the narrow straits by boat. Arabs often appeared in the city, 
shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day.  
“Where are you from?” the boy asked.  
“From many places.”  
“No one can be from many places,” the boy said. “I’m a shepherd, 
and I have  been to many places, but I come from only one place —
from a city near an ancient castle. That’s where I was born.”  
“Well then, we could say that I was born in Salem.”  
The boy didn’t know where Salem was, but he didn’t want to ask, 
fearing that he would app ear ignorant. He looked at the people in 
the plaza for a while; they were coming and going, and all of them 
seemed to be very busy.  
“So, what is Salem like?” he asked, trying to get some sort of clue.  
“It’s like it always has been.”  
No clue yet. But he kne w that Salem wasn’t in Andalusia. If it 
were, he would already have heard of it.  “And what do you do in Salem?” he insisted.  
“What do I do in Salem?” The old man laughed. “Well, I’m the 
king of Salem!”  
People say strange things, the boy thought. Sometimes it’s better 
to be with the sheep, who don’t say anything. And better still to be 
alone with one’s books. They tell their incredible stories at the time 
when you want to hear them. But when you’re talking to people, 
they say some things that are so strange that you don’t know how to 
continue the conversation.  
“My name is Melchizedek,” said the old man. “How many sheep 
do you have?”  
“Enough,” said the boy. He could see that the old man wanted to 
know more about his life.  
“Well, then, we’ve got a problem. I ca n’t help you if you feel 
you’ve got enough sheep.”  
The boy was getting irritated. He wasn’t asking for help. It was 
the old man who had asked for a drink of his wine, and had started 
the conversation.  
“Give me my book,” the boy said. “I have to go and gather my 
sheep and get going.”  
“Give me one -tenth of your sheep,” said the old man, “and I’ll tell 
you how to find the hidden treasure.”  
The boy remembered his dream, and suddenly everything was 
clear to him. The old woman hadn’t charged him anything, but  the 
old man —maybe he was her husband —was going to find a way to 
get much more money in exchange for information about something 
that didn’t even exist. The old man was probably a Gypsy, too.  
But before the boy could say anything, the old man leaned over, 
picked up a stick, and began to write in the sand of the plaza. 
Something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded. With a movement that was too 
quick for someone his age, the man covered whatever it was with  
his cape. When his vision returned to normal, the boy was able to 
read what the old man had written in the sand.  
There, in the sand of the plaza of that small city, the boy read the 
names of his father and his mother and the name of the seminary he 
had at tended. He read the name of the merchant’s daughter, which 
he hadn’t even known, and he read things he had never told anyone.  
 
 
 
“I’M THE KING OF SALEM,” THE OLD MAN HAD SAID.  
“Why would a king be talking with a shepherd?” the boy asked, 
awed and embarrassed.  
“For several reasons. But let’s say that the most important is that 
you have succeeded in discovering your Personal Legend.”  
The boy didn’t know what a person’s “Personal Legend” was.  
“It’s what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, 
when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is.  
“At that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is 
possible. They are not afraid to dream, and to yearn for everything 
they would like to see happen to them in their lives. But, as  time 
passes, a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be 
impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend.”  
None of what the old man was saying made much sense to the 
boy. But he wanted to know what the “mysterious force” was; the 
merch ant’s daughter would be impressed when he told her about 
that!  
“It’s a force that appears to be negative, but actually shows you 
how to realize your Personal Legend. It prepares your spirit and your will, because there is one great truth on this planet: wh oever 
you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want 
something, it’s because that desire originated in the soul of the 
universe. It’s your mission on earth.”  
“Even when all you want to do is travel? Or marry the daughter 
of a textile merchant ?” 
“Yes, or even search for treasure. The Soul of the World is 
nourished by people’s happiness. And also by unhappiness, envy, 
and jealousy. To realize one’s Personal Legend is a person’s only 
real obligation. All things are one.  
“And, when you want someth ing, all the universe conspires in 
helping you to achieve it.”  
They were both silent for a time, observing the plaza and the 
townspeople. It was the old man who spoke first.  
“Why do you tend a flock of sheep?”  
“Because I like to travel.”  
The old man pointe d to a baker standing in his shop window at 
one corner of the plaza. “When he was a child, that man wanted to 
travel, too. But he decided first to buy his bakery and put some 
money aside. When he’s an old man, he’s going to spend a month in 
Africa. He neve r realized that people are capable, at any time in 
their lives, of doing what they dream of.”  
“He should have decided to become a shepherd,” the boy said.  
“Well, he thought about that,” the old man said. “But bakers are 
more important people than shepherds . Bakers have homes, while 
shepherds sleep out in the open. Parents would rather see their 
children marry bakers than shepherds.”  
The boy felt a pang in his heart, thinking about the merchant’s 
daughter. There was surely a baker in her town.  The old man co ntinued, “In the long run, what people think 
about shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them 
than their own Personal Legends.”  
The old man leafed through the book, and fell to reading a page 
he came to. The boy waited, and then interrupted the o ld man just 
as he himself had been interrupted. “Why are you telling me all 
this?”  
“Because you are trying to realize your Personal Legend. And 
you are at the point where you’re about to give it all up.”  
“And that’s when you always appear on the scene?”  
“Not always in this way, but I always appear in one form or 
another. Sometimes I appear in the form of a solution, or a good 
idea. At other times, at a crucial moment, I make it easier for things 
to happen. There are other things I do, too, but most of the t ime 
people don’t realize I’ve done them.”  
The old man related that, the week before, he had been forced to 
appear before a miner, and had taken the form of a stone. The miner 
had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds. For five years 
he had been wo rking a certain river, and had examined hundreds of 
thousands of stones looking for an emerald. The miner was about to 
give it all up, right at the point when, if he were to examine just one 
more stone —just one more —he would find his emerald. Since the 
min er had sacrificed everything to his Personal Legend, the old man 
decided to become involved. He transformed himself into a stone 
that rolled up to the miner’s foot. The miner, with all the anger and 
frustration of his five fruitless years, picked up the st one and threw 
it aside. But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone 
it fell upon, and there, embedded in the broken stone, was the most 
beautiful emerald in the world.  “People learn, early in their lives, what is their reason for being,” 
said the old man, with a certain bitterness. “Maybe that’s why they 
give up on it so early, too. But that’s the way it is.”  
The boy reminded the old man that he had said something about 
hidden treasure.  
“Treasure is uncovered by the force of flowing water, and it is 
buried by the same currents,” said the old man. “If you want to learn 
about your own treasure, you will have to give me one -tenth of your 
flock.”  
“What about one -tenth of my treasure?”  
The old man looked disappointed. “If you start out by promisi ng 
what you don’t even have yet, you’ll lose your desire to work 
toward getting it.”  
The boy told him that he had already promised to give one -tenth 
of his treasure to the Gypsy.  
“Gypsies are experts at getting people to do that,” sighed the old 
man. “In a ny case, it’s good that you’ve learned that everything in 
life has its price. This is what the Warriors of the Light try to teach.”  
The old man returned the book to the boy.  
“Tomorrow, at this same time, bring me a tenth of your flock. 
And I will tell you how to find the hidden treasure. Good afternoon.”  
And he vanished around the corner of the plaza.  
 
 
 
THE BOY BEGAN AGAIN TO READ HIS BOOK, BUT HE WAS NO  longer able to 
concentrate. He was tense and upset, because he knew that the old 
man was right. He went  over to the bakery and bought a loaf of 
bread, thinking about whether or not he should tell the baker what 
the old man had said about him. Sometimes it’s better to leave things as they are, he thought to himself, and decided to say nothing. 
If he were to say anything, the baker would spend three days 
thinking about giving it all up, even though he had gotten used to 
the way things were. The boy could certainly resist causing that 
kind of anxiety for the baker. So he began to wander through the 
city, and fo und himself at the gates. There was a small building 
there, with a window at which people bought tickets to Africa. And 
he knew that Egypt was in Africa.  
“Can I help you?” asked the man behind the window.  
“Maybe tomorrow,” said the boy, moving away. If he sold just 
one of his sheep, he’d have enough to get to the other shore of the 
strait. The idea frightened him.  
“Another dreamer,” said the ticket seller to his assistant, 
watching the boy walk away. “He doesn’t have enough money to 
travel.”  
While standing at the ticket window, the boy had remembered 
his flock, and decided he should go back to being a shepherd. In two 
years he had learned everything about shepherding: he knew how 
to shear sheep, how to care for pregnant ewes, and how to protect 
the sheep fro m wolves. He knew all the fields and pastures of 
Andalusia. And he knew what was the fair price for every one of his 
animals.  
He decided to return to his friend’s stable by the longest route 
possible. As he walked past the city’s castle, he interrupted his  
return, and climbed the stone ramp that led to the top of the wall. 
From there, he could see Africa in the distance. Someone had once 
told him that it was from there that the Moors had come, to occupy 
all of Spain.  
He could see almost the entire city from  where he sat, including 
the plaza where he had talked with the old man. Curse the moment I met that old man, he thought. He had come to the town only to find 
a woman who could interpret his dream. Neither the woman nor the 
old man was at all impressed by the fact that he was a shepherd. 
They were solitary individuals who no longer believed in things, 
and didn’t understand that shepherds become attached to their 
sheep. He knew everything about each member of his flock: he 
knew which ones were lame, which on e was to give birth two 
months from now, and which were the laziest. He knew how to 
shear them, and how to slaughter them. If he ever decided to leave 
them, they would suffer.  
The wind began to pick up. He knew that wind: people called it 
the levanter, bec ause on it the Moors had come from the Levant at 
the eastern end of the Mediterranean.  
The levanter increased in intensity. Here I am, between my flock 
and my treasure, the boy thought. He had to choose between 
something he had become accustomed to and som ething he wanted 
to have. There was also the merchant’s daughter, but she wasn’t as 
important as his flock, because she didn’t depend on him. Maybe she 
didn’t even remember him. He was sure that it made no difference 
to her on which day he appeared: for he r, every day was the same, 
and when each day is the same as the next, it’s because people fail to 
recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that 
the sun rises.  
I left my father, my mother, and the town castle behind. They 
have gotten u sed to my being away, and so have I. The sheep will get 
used to my not being there, too, the boy thought.  
From where he sat, he could observe the plaza. People continued 
to come and go from the baker’s shop. A young couple sat on the 
bench where he had tal ked with the old man, and they kissed.  “That baker…” he said to himself, without completing the 
thought. The levanter was still getting stronger, and he felt its force 
on his face. That wind had brought the Moors, yes, but it had also 
brought the smell of the desert and of veiled women. It had brought 
with it the sweat and the dreams of men who had once left to search 
for the unknown, and for gold and adventure —and for the 
Pyramids. The boy felt jealous of the freedom of the wind, and saw 
that he could have  the same freedom. There was nothing to hold 
him back except himself. The sheep, the merchant’s daughter, and 
the fields of Andalusia were only steps along the way to his Personal 
Legend.  
The next day, the boy met the old man at noon. He brought six 
sheep with him.  
“I’m surprised,” the boy said. “My friend bought all the other 
sheep immediately. He said that he had always dreamed of being a 
shepherd, and that it was a good omen.”  
“That’s the way it always is,” said the old man. “It’s called the 
principle of  favorability. When you play cards the first time, you are 
almost sure to win. Beginner’s luck.”  
“Why is that?”  
“Because there is a force that wants you to realize your Personal 
Legend; it whets your appetite with a taste of success.”  
Then the old man began to inspect the sheep, and he saw that 
one was lame. The boy explained that it wasn’t important, since that 
sheep was the most intelligent of the flock, and produced the most 
wool.  
“Where is the treasure?” he asked.  
“It’s in Egypt, near the Pyramids.”  
The boy was startled. The old woman had said the same thing. 
But she hadn’t charged him anything.  “In order to find the treasure, you will have to follow the omens. 
God has prepared a path for everyone to follow. You just have to 
read the omens that he le ft for you.”  
Before the boy could reply, a butterfly appeared and fluttered 
between him and the old man. He remembered something his 
grandfather had once told him: that butterflies were a good omen. 
Like crickets, and like grasshoppers; like lizards and fo ur-leaf 
clovers.  
“That’s right,” said the old man, able to read the boy’s thoughts. 
“Just as your grandfather taught you. These are good omens.”  
The old man opened his cape, and the boy was struck by what he 
saw. The old man wore a breastplate of heavy gol d, covered with 
precious stones. The boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on 
the previous day.  
He really was a king! He must be disguised to avoid encounters 
with thieves.  
“Take these,” said the old man, holding out a white stone and a 
black stone th at had been embedded at the center of the 
breastplate. “They are called Urim and Thummim. The black 
signifies ‘yes,’ and the white ‘no.’ When you are unable to read the 
omens, they will help you to do so. Always ask an objective 
question.  
“But, if you can,  try to make your own decisions. The treasure is 
at the Pyramids; that you already knew. But I had to insist on the 
payment of six sheep because I helped you to make your decision.”  
The boy put the stones in his pouch. From then on, he would 
make his own d ecisions.  
“Don’t forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and 
nothing else. And don’t forget the language of omens. And, above all, don’t forget to follow your Personal Legend through to its 
conclusion.  
“But before I go, I want to tell you a little story.  
“A certain shopkeeper sent his son to learn about the secret of 
happiness from the wisest man in the world. The lad wandered 
through the desert for forty days, and finally came upon a beautiful 
castle, high atop a mountain. It was there that the wise man lived.  
“Rather than finding a saintly man, though, our hero, on entering 
the main room of the castle, saw a hive of activity: tradesmen came 
and went, people were conversing in the corners, a small orchestra 
was playing soft music, and there w as a table covered with platters 
of the most delicious food in that part of the world. The wise man 
conversed with everyone, and the boy had to wait for two hours 
before it was his turn to be given the man’s attention.  
“The wise man listened attentively to  the boy’s explanation of 
why he had come, but told him that he didn’t have time just then to 
explain the secret of happiness. He suggested that the boy look 
around the palace and return in two hours.  
“‘Meanwhile, I want to ask you to do something,’ said t he wise 
man, handing the boy a teaspoon that held two drops of oil. ‘As you 
wander around, carry this spoon with you without allowing the oil 
to spill.’  
“The boy began climbing and descending the many stairways of 
the palace, keeping his eyes fixed on the spoon. After two hours, he 
returned to the room where the wise man was.  
“‘Well,’ asked the wise man, ‘did you see the Persian tapestries 
that are hanging in my dining hall? Did you see the garden that it 
took the master gardener ten years to create? Did yo u notice the 
beautiful parchments in my library?’  “The boy was embarrassed, and confessed that he had observed 
nothing. His only concern had been not to spill the oil that the wise 
man had entrusted to him.  
“‘Then go back and observe the marvels of my worl d,’ said the 
wise man. ‘You cannot trust a man if you don’t know his house.’  
“Relieved, the boy picked up the spoon and returned to his 
exploration of the palace, this time observing all of the works of art 
on the ceilings and the walls. He saw the gardens , the mountains all 
around him, the beauty of the flowers, and the taste with which 
everything had been selected. Upon returning to the wise man, he 
related in detail everything he had seen.  
“‘But where are the drops of oil I entrusted to you?’ asked the 
wise man.  
“Looking down at the spoon he held, the boy saw that the oil was 
gone.  
“‘Well, there is only one piece of advice I can give you,’ said the 
wisest of wise men. ‘The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels 
of the world, and never to forget the  drops of oil on the spoon.’”  
The shepherd said nothing. He had understood the story the old 
king had told him. A shepherd may like to travel, but he should 
never forget about his sheep.  
The old man looked at the boy and, with his hands held together, 
made  several strange gestures over the boy’s head. Then, taking his 
sheep, he walked away.  
 
 
 
AT THE HIGHEST POINT IN  TARIFA THERE IS AN OLD FORT,  built by the 
Moors. From atop its walls, one can catch a glimpse of Africa. 
Melchizedek, the king of Salem, sat on the wall of the fort that afternoon, and felt the levanter blowing in his face. The sheep 
fidgeted nearby, uneasy with their new owner and e xcited by so 
much change. All they wanted was food and water.  
Melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out 
of the port. He would never again see the boy, just as he had never 
seen Abraham again after having charged him his one -tenth fee. 
That was his work.  
The gods should not have desires, because they don’t have 
Personal Legends. But the king of Salem hoped desperately that the 
boy would be successful.  
It’s too bad that he’s quickly going to forget my name, he 
thought. I should have repeat ed it for him. Then when he spoke 
about me he would say that I am Melchizedek, the king of Salem.  
He looked to the skies, feeling a bit abashed, and said, “I know 
it’s the vanity of vanities, as you said, my Lord. But an old king 
sometimes has to take some  pride in himself.”  
 
 
 
HOW STRANGE  AFRICA IS, THOUGHT THE BOY.  
He was sitting in a bar very much like the other bars he had seen 
along the narrow streets of Tangier. Some men were smoking from 
a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other. In just  a few 
hours he had seen men walking hand in hand, women with their 
faces covered, and priests that climbed to the tops of towers and 
chanted —as everyone about him went to their knees and placed 
their foreheads on the ground.  
“A practice of infidels,” he s aid to himself. As a child in church, he 
had always looked at the image of Saint Santiago Matamoros on his 
white horse, his sword unsheathed, and figures such as these kneeling at his feet. The boy felt ill and terribly alone. The infidels 
had an evil look  about them.  
Besides this, in the rush of his travels he had forgotten a detail, 
just one detail, which could keep him from his treasure for a long 
time: only Arabic was spoken in this country.  
The owner of the bar approached him, and the boy pointed to a 
drink that had been served at the next table. It turned out to be a 
bitter tea. The boy preferred wine.  
But he didn’t need to worry about that right now. What he had 
to be concerned about was his treasure, and how he was going to go 
about getting it. The s ale of his sheep had left him with enough 
money in his pouch, and the boy knew that in money there was 
magic; whoever has money is never really alone. Before long, maybe 
in just a few days, he would be at the Pyramids. An old man, with a 
breastplate of gol d, wouldn’t have lied just to acquire six sheep.  
The old man had spoken about signs and omens, and, as the boy 
was crossing the strait, he had thought about omens. Yes, the old 
man had known what he was talking about: during the time the boy 
had spent in t he fields of Andalusia, he had become used to learning 
which path he should take by observing the ground and the sky. He 
had discovered that the presence of a certain bird meant that a 
snake was nearby, and that a certain shrub was a sign that there 
was wa ter in the area. The sheep had taught him that.  
If God leads the sheep so well, he will also lead a man, he 
thought, and that made him feel better. The tea seemed less bitter.  
“Who are you?” he heard a voice ask him in Spanish.  
The boy was relieved. He was  thinking about omens, and 
someone had appeared.  “How come you speak Spanish?” he asked. The new arrival was a 
young man in Western dress, but the color of his skin suggested he 
was from this city. He was about the same age and height as the boy.  
“Almost e veryone here speaks Spanish. We’re only two hours 
from Spain.”  
“Sit down, and let me treat you to something,” said the boy. “And 
ask for a glass of wine for me. I hate this tea.”  
“There is no wine in this country,” the young man said. “The 
religion here fo rbids it.”  
The boy told him then that he needed to get to the Pyramids. He 
almost began to tell about his treasure, but decided not to do so. If 
he did, it was possible that the Arab would want a part of it as 
payment for taking him there. He remembered wh at the old man 
had said about offering something you didn’t even have yet.  
“I’d like you to take me there if you can. I can pay you to serve as 
my guide.”  
“Do you have any idea how to get there?” the newcomer asked.  
The boy noticed that the owner of the ba r stood nearby, 
listening attentively to their conversation. He felt uneasy at the 
man’s presence. But he had found a guide, and didn’t want to miss 
out on an opportunity.  
“You have to cross the entire Sahara desert,” said the young man. 
“And to do that, you need money. I need to know whether you have 
enough.”  
The boy thought it a strange question. But he trusted in the old 
man, who had said that, when you really want something, the 
universe always conspires in your favor.  
He took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young 
man. The owner of the bar came over and looked, as well. The two men exchanged some words in Arabic, and the bar owner seemed 
irritated.  
“Let’s get out of here,” said the new arrival. “He wants us to 
leave.”  
The boy was relieved.  He got up to pay the bill, but the owner 
grabbed him and began to speak to him in an angry stream of 
words. The boy was strong, and wanted to retaliate, but he was in a 
foreign country. His new friend pushed the owner aside, and pulled 
the boy outside wit h him. “He wanted your money,” he said. 
“Tangier is not like the rest of Africa. This is a port, and every port 
has its thieves.”  
The boy trusted his new friend. He had helped him out in a 
dangerous situation. He took out his money and counted it.  
“We coul d get to the Pyramids by tomorrow,” said the other, 
taking the money. “But I have to buy two camels.”  
They walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier. 
Everywhere there were stalls with items for sale. They reached the 
center of a large plaza whe re the market was held. There were 
thousands of people there, arguing, selling, and buying; vegetables 
for sale amongst daggers, and carpets displayed alongside tobacco. 
But the boy never took his eye off his new friend. After all, he had all 
his money. He  thought about asking him to give it back, but decided 
that would be unfriendly. He knew nothing about the customs of the 
strange land he was in.  
“I’ll just watch him,” he said to himself. He knew he was stronger 
than his friend.  
Suddenly, there in the mid st of all that confusion, he saw the 
most beautiful sword he had ever seen. The scabbard was embossed 
in silver, and the handle was black and encrusted with precious stones. The boy promised himself that, when he returned from 
Egypt, he would buy that swor d. 
“Ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs,” he said 
to his friend. Then he realized that he had been distracted for a few 
moments, looking at the sword. His heart squeezed, as if his chest 
had suddenly compressed it. He was afraid to look ar ound, because 
he knew what he would find. He continued to look at the beautiful 
sword for a bit longer, until he summoned the courage to turn 
around.  
All around him was the market, with people coming and going, 
shouting and buying, and the aroma of strange  foods…but nowhere 
could he find his new companion.  
The boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become 
separated from him by accident. He decided to stay right there and 
await his return. As he waited, a priest climbed to the top of a 
nearby tower  and began his chant; everyone in the market fell to 
their knees, touched their foreheads to the ground, and took up the 
chant. Then, like a colony of worker ants, they dismantled their 
stalls and left.  
The sun began its departure, as well. The boy watched  it through 
its trajectory for some time, until it was hidden behind the white 
houses surrounding the plaza. He recalled that when the sun had 
risen that morning, he was on another continent, still a shepherd 
with sixty sheep, and looking forward to meetin g with a girl. That 
morning he had known everything that was going to happen to him 
as he walked through the familiar fields. But now, as the sun began 
to set, he was in a different country, a stranger in a strange land, 
where he couldn’t even speak the la nguage. He was no longer a 
shepherd, and he had nothing, not even the money to return and 
start everything over.  All this happened between sunrise and sunset, the boy thought. 
He was feeling sorry for himself, and lamenting the fact that his life 
could hav e changed so suddenly and so drastically.  
He was so ashamed that he wanted to cry. He had never even 
wept in front of his own sheep. But the marketplace was empty, and 
he was far from home, so he wept. He wept because God was unfair, 
and because this was t he way God repaid those who believed in 
their dreams.  
When I had my sheep, I was happy, and I made those around me 
happy. People saw me coming and welcomed me, he thought. But 
now I’m sad and alone. I’m going to become bitter and distrustful of 
people beca use one person betrayed me. I’m going to hate those 
who have found their treasure because I never found mine. And I’m 
going to hold on to what little I have, because I’m too insignificant to 
conquer the world.  
He opened his pouch to see what was left of hi s possessions; 
maybe there was a bit left of the sandwich he had eaten on the ship. 
But all he found was the heavy book, his jacket, and the two stones 
the old man had given him.  
As he looked at the stones, he felt relieved for some reason. He 
had exchange d six sheep for two precious stones that had been 
taken from a gold breastplate. He could sell the stones and buy a 
return ticket. But this time I’ll be smarter, the boy thought, 
removing them from the pouch so he could put them in his pocket. 
This was a p ort town, and the only truthful thing his friend had told 
him was that port towns are full of thieves.  
Now he understood why the owner of the bar had been so upset: 
he was trying to tell him not to trust that man. “I’m like everyone 
else —I see the world in  terms of what I would like to see happen, 
not what actually does.”  He ran his fingers slowly over the stones, sensing their 
temperature and feeling their surfaces. They were his treasure. Just 
handling them made him feel better. They reminded him of the o ld 
man.  
“When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping 
you to achieve it,” he had said.  
The boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man 
had said. There he was in the empty marketplace, without a cent to 
his name, and with no t a sheep to guard through the night. But the 
stones were proof that he had met with a king —a king who knew of 
the boy’s past.  
“They’re called Urim and Thummim, and they can help you to 
read the omens.” The boy put the stones back in the pouch and 
decided to do an experiment. The old man had said to ask very clear 
questions, and to do that, the boy had to know what he wanted. So, 
he asked if the old man’s blessing was still with him.  
He took out one of the stones. It was “yes.”  
“Am I going to find my treasu re?” he asked.  
He stuck his hand into the pouch, and felt around for one of the 
stones. As he did so, both of them pushed through a hole in the 
pouch and fell to the ground. The boy had never even noticed that 
there was a hole in his pouch. He knelt down t o find Urim and 
Thummim and put them back in the pouch. But as he saw them lying 
there on the ground, another phrase came to his mind.  
“Learn to recognize omens, and follow them,” the old king had 
said.  
An omen. The boy smiled to himself. He picked up the two 
stones and put them back in his pouch. He didn’t consider mending 
the hole —the stones could fall through any time they wanted. He 
had learned that there were certain things one shouldn’t ask about, so as not to flee from one’s own Personal Legend. “I p romised that I 
would make my own decisions,” he said to himself.  
But the stones had told him that the old man was still with him, 
and that made him feel more confident. He looked around at the 
empty plaza again, feeling less desperate than before. This wasn’t a 
strange place; it was a new one.  
After all, what he had always wanted was just that: to know new 
places. Even if he never got to the Pyramids, he had already traveled 
farther than any shepherd he knew. Oh, if they only knew how 
different things ar e just two hours by ship from where they are, he 
thought. Although his new world at the moment was just an empty 
marketplace, he had already seen it when it was teeming with life, 
and he would never forget it. He remembered the sword. It hurt him 
a bit to think about it, but he had never seen one like it before. As he 
mused about these things, he realized that he had to choose 
between thinking of himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an 
adventurer in quest of his treasure.  
“I’m an adventurer, looking  for treasure,” he said to himself.  
 
 
 
HE WAS SHAKEN INTO WAKEFULNESS BY SOMEONE.  HE had fallen asleep in 
the middle of the marketplace, and life in the plaza was about to 
resume.  
Looking around, he sought his sheep, and then realized that he 
was in a new world. But instead of being saddened, he was happy. 
He no longer had to seek out food and water for the sheep; he could 
go in search of his treasure, instead. He had not a cent in his pocket, 
but he had faith. He had decided, the night before, that he woul d be 
as much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books.  He walked slowly through the market. The merchants were 
assembling their stalls, and the boy helped a candy seller to do his. 
The candy seller had a smile on his face: he was happy, aware of 
what his life was about, and ready to begin a day’s work. His smile 
reminded the boy of the old man —the mysterious old king he had 
met. “This candy merchant isn’t making candy so that later he can 
travel or marry a shopkeeper’s daughter. He’s doing it becau se it’s 
what he wants to do,” thought the boy. He realized that he could do 
the same thing the old man had done —sense whether a person was 
near to or far from his Personal Legend. Just by looking at them. It’s 
easy, and yet I’ve never done it before, he th ought.  
When the stall was assembled, the candy seller offered the boy 
the first sweet he had made for the day. The boy thanked him, ate it, 
and went on his way. When he had gone only a short distance, he 
realized that, while they were erecting the stall, o ne of them had 
spoken Arabic and the other Spanish.  
And they had understood each other perfectly well.  
There must be a language that doesn’t depend on words, the boy 
thought. I’ve already had that experience with my sheep, and now 
it’s happening with peopl e. 
He was learning a lot of new things. Some of them were things 
that he had already experienced, and weren’t really new, but that he 
had never perceived before. And he hadn’t perceived them because 
he had become accustomed to them. He realized: If I can l earn to 
understand this language without words, I can learn to understand 
the world.  
Relaxed and unhurried, he resolved that he would walk through 
the narrow streets of Tangier. Only in that way would he be able to 
read the omens. He knew it would require a lot of patience, but 
shepherds know all about patience. Once again he saw that, in that strange land, he was applying the same lessons he had learned with 
his sheep.  
“All things are one,” the old man had said.  
 
 
 
THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT AWOKE WITH THE DAY, AND FELT  the same anxiety 
that he felt every morning. He had been in the same place for thirty 
years: a shop at the top of a hilly street where few customers 
passed. Now it was too late to change anything —the only thing he 
had ever learned to do was to buy  and sell crystal glassware. There 
had been a time when many people knew of his shop: Arab 
merchants, French and English geologists, German soldiers who 
were always well -heeled. In those days it had been wonderful to be 
selling crystal, and he had thought how he would become rich, and 
have beautiful women at his side as he grew older.  
But, as time passed, Tangier had changed. The nearby city of 
Ceuta had grown faster than Tangier, and business had fallen off. 
Neighbors moved away, and there remained only a few small shops 
on the hill. And no one was going to climb the hill just to browse 
through a few small shops.  
But the crystal merchant had no choice. He had lived thirty years 
of his life buying and selling crystal pieces, and now it was too late 
to do any thing else.  
He spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings 
and goings in the street. He had done this for years, and knew the 
schedule of everyone who passed. But, just before lunchtime, a boy 
stopped in front of the shop. He was dressed norm ally, but the 
practiced eyes of the crystal merchant could see that the boy had no money to spend. Nevertheless, the merchant decided to delay his 
lunch for a few minutes until the boy moved on.  
 
 
 
A CARD HANGING IN THE DOORWAY ANNOUNCED THAT  several langu ages 
were spoken in the shop. The boy saw a man appear behind the 
counter.  
“I can clean up those glasses in the window, if you want,” said 
the boy. “The way they look now, nobody is going to want to buy 
them.”  
The man looked at him without responding.  
“In exchange, you could give me something to eat.”  
The man still said nothing, and the boy sensed that he was going 
to have to make a decision. In his pouch, he had his jacket —he 
certainly wasn’t going to need it in the desert. Taking the jacket out, 
he began to clean the glasses. In half an hour, he had cleaned all the 
glasses in the window, and, as he was doing so, two customers had 
entered the shop and bought some crystal.  
When he had completed the cleaning, he asked the man for 
something to eat. “Let’s go a nd have some lunch,” said the crystal 
merchant.  
He put a sign on the door, and they went to a small café nearby. 
As they sat down at the only table in the place, the crystal merchant 
laughed.  
“You didn’t have to do any cleaning,” he said. “The Koran 
requir es me to feed a hungry person.”  
“Well then, why did you let me do it?” the boy asked.  
“Because the crystal was dirty. And both you and I needed to 
cleanse our minds of negative thoughts.”  When they had eaten, the merchant turned to the boy and said, 
“I’d l ike you to work in my shop. Two customers came in today 
while you were working, and that’s a good omen.”  
People talk a lot about omens, thought the shepherd. But they 
really don’t know what they’re saying. Just as I hadn’t realized that 
for so many years I  had been speaking a language without words to 
my sheep.  
“Do you want to go to work for me?” the merchant asked.  
“I can work for the rest of today,” the boy answered. “I’ll work all 
night, until dawn, and I’ll clean every piece of crystal in your shop. 
In return, I need money to get to Egypt tomorrow.”  
The merchant laughed. “Even if you cleaned my crystal for an 
entire year…even if you earned a good commission selling every 
piece, you would still have to borrow money to get to Egypt. There 
are thousands of kilometers of desert between here and there.”  
There was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the 
city was asleep. No sound from the bazaars, no arguments among 
the merchants, no men climbing to the towers to chant. No hope, no 
adventure, no old k ings or Personal Legends, no treasure, and no 
Pyramids. It was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy’s 
soul had. He sat there, staring blankly through the door of the café, 
wishing that he had died, and that everything would end forever at 
that  moment.  
The merchant looked anxiously at the boy. All the joy he had 
seen that morning had suddenly disappeared.  
“I can give you the money you need to get back to your country, 
my son,” said the crystal merchant.  
The boy said nothing. He got up, adjusted his clothing, and 
picked up his pouch.  
“I’ll work for you,” he said.  And after another long silence, he added, “I need money to buy 
some sheep.”  
  
PART TWO  
 
 
  
 
 
 
THE BOY HAD BEEN W ORKING FOR THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT  for almost a 
month, and he could see that it wasn’t exactly the kind of job that 
would make him happy. The merchant spent the entire day 
mumbling behind the counter, telling the boy to be careful with the 
pieces and not to b reak anything.  
But he stayed with the job because the merchant, although he 
was an old grouch, treated him fairly; the boy received a good 
commission for each piece he sold, and had already been able to put 
some money aside. That morning he had done some calculating: if 
he continued to work every day as he had been, he would need a 
whole year to be able to buy some sheep.  
“I’d like to build a display case for the crystal,” the boy said to 
the merchant. “We could place it outside, and attract those people 
who pass at the bottom of the hill.”  
“I’ve never had one before,” the merchant answered. “People 
will pass by and bump into it, and pieces will be broken.”  
“Well, when I took my sheep through the fields some of them 
might have died if we had come upon a sna ke. But that’s the way life 
is with sheep and with shepherds.”  
The merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal 
glasses. He was selling better than ever…as if time had turned back 
to the old days when the street had been one of Tangier’s major 
attractions.  
“Business has really improved,” he said to the boy, after the 
customer had left. “I’m doing much better, and soon you’ll be able to 
return to your sheep. Why ask more out of life?”  “Because we have to respond to omens,” the boy said, almost 
without meaning to; then he regretted what he had said, because 
the merchant had never met the king.  
“It’s called the principle of favorability, beginner’s luck. Because 
life wants you to achieve your Personal Legend,” the old king had 
said.  
But the merchant  understood what the boy had said. The boy’s 
very presence in the shop was an omen, and, as time passed and 
money was pouring into the cash drawer, he had no regrets about 
having hired the boy. The boy was being paid more money than he 
deserved, because th e merchant, thinking that sales wouldn’t 
amount to much, had offered the boy a high commission rate. He 
had assumed he would soon return to his sheep.  
“Why did you want to get to the Pyramids?” he asked, to get 
away from the business of the display.  
“Becau se I’ve always heard about them,” the boy answered, 
saying nothing about his dream. The treasure was now nothing but 
a painful memory, and he tried to avoid thinking about it.  
“I don’t know anyone around here who would want to cross the 
desert just to see the Pyramids,” said the merchant. “They’re just a 
pile of stones. You could build one in your backyard.”  
“You’ve never had dreams of travel,” said the boy, turning to 
wait on a customer who had entered the shop.  
Two days later, the merchant spoke to the bo y about the display.  
“I don’t much like change,” he said. “You and I aren’t like Hassan, 
that rich merchant. If he makes a buying mistake, it doesn’t affect 
him much. But we two have to live with our mistakes.”  
That’s true enough, the boy thought, ruefully . 
“Why did you think we should have the display?”  “I want to get back to my sheep faster. We have to take 
advantage when luck is on our side, and do as much to help it as it’s 
doing to help us. It’s called the principle of favorability. Or 
beginner’s luck. ” 
The merchant was silent for a few moments. Then he said, “The 
Prophet gave us the Koran, and left us just five obligations to satisfy 
during our lives. The most important is to believe only in the one 
true God. The others are to pray five times a day, fa st during 
Ramadan, and be charitable to the poor.”  
He stopped there. His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the 
Prophet. He was a devout man, and, even with all his impatience, he 
wanted to live his life in accordance with Muslim law.  
“What’s the fifth obligation?” the boy asked.  
“Two days ago, you said that I had never dreamed of travel,” the 
merchant answered. “The fifth obligation of every Muslim is a 
pilgrimage. We are obliged, at least once in our lives, to visit the 
holy city of Mecca.  
“Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids. When I was 
young, all I wanted to do was put together enough money to start 
this shop. I thought that someday I’d be rich, and could go to Mecca. 
I began to make some money, but I could never bring myself to 
leave someon e in charge of the shop; the crystals are delicate things. 
At the same time, people were passing my shop all the time, heading 
for Mecca. Some of them were rich pilgrims, traveling in caravans 
with servants and camels, but most of the people making the 
pilgrimage were poorer than I.  
“All who went there were happy at having done so. They placed 
the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses. One of 
them, a cobbler who made his living mending boots, said that he had 
traveled for almost a year thro ugh the desert, but that he got more tired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his 
leather.”  
“Well, why don’t you go to Mecca now?” asked the boy.  
“Because it’s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive. That’s 
what helps me face these  days that are all the same, these mute 
crystals on the shelves, and lunch and dinner at that same horrible 
café. I’m afraid that if my dream is realized, I’ll have no reason to go 
on living.  
“You dream about your sheep and the Pyramids, but you’re 
differe nt from me, because you want to realize your dreams. I just 
want to dream about Mecca. I’ve already imagined a thousand times 
crossing the desert, arriving at the Plaza of the Sacred Stone, the 
seven times I walk around it before allowing myself to touch i t. I’ve 
already imagined the people who would be at my side, and those in 
front of me, and the conversations and prayers we would share. But 
I’m afraid that it would all be a disappointment, so I prefer just to 
dream about it.”  
That day, the merchant gave the boy permission to build the 
display. Not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same 
way.  
 
 
 
TWO MORE MONTHS PASSED, AND THE SHELF BROUGHT  many customers 
into the crystal shop. The boy estimated that, if he worked for six 
more months, he could return to Spain and buy sixty sheep, and yet 
another sixty. In less than a year, he would have doubled his flock, 
and he would be able to do business with the Arabs, because he was 
now able to speak their strange language. Since that morning in the 
marketplace, he had never again made use of Urim and Thummim, because Egypt was now just as distant a dream for him as was 
Mecca for the merchant. Anyway, th e boy had become happy in his 
work, and thought all the time about the day when he would 
disembark at Tarifa as a winner.  
“You must always know what it is that you want,” the old king 
had said. The boy knew, and was now working toward it. Maybe it 
was his treasure to have wound up in that strange land, met up with 
a thief, and doubled the size of his flock without spending a cent.  
He was proud of himself. He had learned some important things, 
like how to deal in crystal, and about the language without 
words …and about omens. One afternoon he had seen a man at the 
top of the hill, complaining that it was impossible to find a decent 
place to get something to drink after such a climb. The boy, 
accustomed to recognizing omens, spoke to the merchant.  
“Let’s sell t ea to the people who climb the hill.”  
“Lots of places sell tea around here,” the merchant said.  
“But we could sell tea in crystal glasses. The people will enjoy 
the tea and want to buy the glasses. I have been told that beauty is 
the great seducer of men.”  
The merchant didn’t respond, but that afternoon, after saying his 
prayers and closing the shop, he invited the boy to sit with him and 
share his hookah, that strange pipe used by the Arabs.  
“What is it you’re looking for?” asked the old merchant.  
“I’ve al ready told you. I need to buy my sheep back, so I have to 
earn the money to do so.”  
The merchant put some new coals in the hookah, and inhaled 
deeply.  
“I’ve had this shop for thirty years. I know good crystal from bad, 
and everything else there is to know about crystal. I know its dimensions and how it behaves. If we serve tea in crystal, the shop 
is going to expand. And then I’ll have to change my way of life.”  
“Well, isn’t that good?”  
“I’m already used to the way things are. Before you came, I was 
thinkin g about how much time I had wasted in the same place, while 
my friends had moved on, and either went bankrupt or did better 
than they had before. It made me very depressed. Now, I can see 
that it hasn’t been too bad. The shop is exactly the size I always 
wanted it to be. I don’t want to change anything, because I don’t 
know how to deal with change. I’m used to the way I am.”  
The boy didn’t know what to say. The old man continued, “You 
have been a real blessing to me. Today, I understand something I 
didn’t s ee before: every blessing ignored becomes a curse. I don’t 
want anything else in life. But you are forcing me to look at wealth 
and at horizons I have never known. Now that I have seen them, and 
now that I see how immense my possibilities are, I’m going to  feel 
worse than I did before you arrived. Because I know the things I 
should be able to accomplish, and I don’t want to do so.”  
It’s good I refrained from saying anything to the baker in Tarifa, 
thought the boy to himself.  
They went on smoking the pipe fo r a while as the sun began to 
set. They were conversing in Arabic, and the boy was proud of 
himself for being able to do so. There had been a time when he 
thought that his sheep could teach him everything he needed to 
know about the world. But they could n ever have taught him Arabic.  
There are probably other things in the world that the sheep can’t 
teach me, thought the boy as he regarded the old merchant. All they 
ever do, really, is look for food and water. And maybe it wasn’t that 
they were teaching me, but that I was learning from them.  
“Maktub,”  the merchant said, finally.  “What does that mean?”  
“You would have to have been born an Arab to understand,” he 
answered. “But in your language it would be something like ‘It is 
written.’”  
And, as he smothered t he coals in the hookah, he told the boy 
that he could begin to sell tea in the crystal glasses. Sometimes, 
there’s just no way to hold back the river.  
 
 
 
THE MEN CLIMBED THE HILL, AND THEY WERE TIRED  when they reached 
the top. But there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing 
mint tea. They went in to drink the tea, which was served in 
beautiful crystal glasses.  
“My wife never thought of this,” said one, and he bought some 
crystal —he was entertaining guests that night, and the guests 
would be impressed by the beauty of the glassware. The other man 
remarked that tea was always more delicious when it was served in 
crystal, because the aroma was retained. The third said that it was a 
tradition in the Orient to use crystal glasses for tea because i t had 
magical powers.  
Before long, the news spread, and a great many people began to 
climb the hill to see the shop that was doing something new in a 
trade that was so old. Other shops were opened that served tea in 
crystal, but they weren’t at the top of a hill, and they had little 
business.  
Eventually, the merchant had to hire two more employees. He 
began to import enormous quantities of tea, along with his crystal, 
and his shop was sought out by men and women with a thirst for 
things new.  And, in that way, the months passed.  
 
 
 
THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN. IT HAD BEEN ELEVEN  months and nine 
days since he had first set foot on the African continent.  
He dressed in his Arabian clothing of white linen, bought 
especially for this day. He put his headcloth in p lace and secured it 
with a ring made of camel skin. Wearing his new sandals, he 
descended the stairs silently.  
The city was still sleeping. He prepared himself a sandwich and 
drank some hot tea from a crystal glass. Then he sat in the sun -filled 
doorway, s moking the hookah.  
He smoked in silence, thinking of nothing, and listening to the 
sound of the wind that brought the scent of the desert. When he had 
finished his smoke, he reached into one of his pockets, and sat there 
for a few moments, regarding what h e had withdrawn.  
It was a bundle of money. Enough to buy himself a hundred and 
twenty sheep, a return ticket, and a license to import products from 
Africa into his own country.  
He waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the 
shop. Then the two went off to have some more tea.  
“I’m leaving today,” said the boy. “I have the money I need to buy 
my sheep. And you have the money you need to go to Mecca.”  
The old man said nothing.  
“Will you give me your blessing?” asked the boy. “You have 
helped me.” T he man continued to prepare his tea, saying nothing. 
Then he turned to the boy.  “I am proud of you,” he said. “You brought a new feeling into my 
crystal shop. But you know that I’m not going to go to Mecca. Just as 
you know that you’re not going to buy you r sheep.”  
“Who told you that?” asked the boy, startled.  
“Maktub,”  said the old crystal merchant.  
And he gave the boy his blessing.  
 
 
 
THE BOY WENT TO HIS ROOM AND PACKED HIS BELONGINGS . They filled three 
sacks. As he was leaving, he saw, in the corner of t he room, his old 
shepherd’s pouch. It was bunched up, and he had hardly thought of 
it for a long time. As he took his jacket out of the pouch, thinking to 
give it to someone in the street, the two stones fell to the floor. Urim 
and Thummim.  
It made the boy  think of the old king, and it startled him to 
realize how long it had been since he had thought of him. For nearly 
a year, he had been working incessantly, thinking only of putting 
aside enough money so that he could return to Spain with pride.  
“Never sto p dreaming,” the old king had said. “Follow the 
omens.”  
The boy picked up Urim and Thummim, and, once again, had the 
strange sensation that the old king was nearby. He had worked hard 
for a year, and the omens were that it was time to go.  
I’m going to go b ack to doing just what I did before, the boy 
thought. Even though the sheep didn’t teach me to speak Arabic.  
But the sheep had taught him something even more important: 
that there was a language in the world that everyone understood, a 
language the boy had  used throughout the time that he was trying 
to improve things at the shop. It was the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose, and as part of a search 
for something believed in and desired. Tangier was no longer a 
strange city , and he felt that, just as he had conquered this place, he 
could conquer the world.  
“When you want something, all the universe conspires to help 
you achieve it,” the old king had said.  
But the old king hadn’t said anything about being robbed, or 
about end less deserts, or about people who know what their 
dreams are but don’t want to realize them. The old king hadn’t told 
him that the Pyramids were just a pile of stones, or that anyone 
could build one in his backyard. And he had forgotten to mention 
that, wh en you have enough money to buy a flock larger than the 
one you had before, you should buy it.  
The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things. He 
went down the stairs and found the merchant waiting on a foreign 
couple, while two other customers walked about the shop, drinking 
tea from crystal glasses. It was more activity than usual for this time 
of the morning. From where he stood, he saw for the first time that 
the old merchant’s hair was very much like the hair of the old king. 
He re membered the smile of the candy seller, on his first day in 
Tangier, when he had nothing to eat and nowhere to go —that smile 
had also been like the old king’s smile.  
It’s almost as if he had been here and left his mark, he thought. 
And yet, none of these p eople has ever met the old king. On the 
other hand, he said that he always appeared to help those who are 
trying to realize their Personal Legend.  
He left without saying good -bye to the crystal merchant. He 
didn’t want to cry with the other people there. H e was going to miss 
the place and all the good things he had learned. He was more confident in himself, though, and felt as though he could conquer 
the world.  
“But I’m going back to the fields that I know, to take care of my 
flock again.” He said that to h imself with certainty, but he was no 
longer happy with his decision. He had worked for an entire year to 
make a dream come true, and that dream, minute by minute, was 
becoming less important. Maybe because that wasn’t really his 
dream.  
Who knows…maybe it’s  better to be like the crystal merchant: 
never go to Mecca, and just go through life wanting to do so, he 
thought, again trying to convince himself. But as he held Urim and 
Thummim in his hand, they had transmitted to him the strength and 
will of the old k ing. By coincidence —or maybe it was an omen, the 
boy thought —he came to the bar he had entered on his first day 
there. The thief wasn’t there, and the owner brought him a cup of 
tea. 
I can always go back to being a shepherd, the boy thought. I 
learned how to care for sheep, and I haven’t forgotten how that’s 
done. But maybe I’ll never have another chance to get to the 
Pyramids in Egypt. The old man wore a breastplate of gold, and he 
knew about my past. He really was a king, a wise king.  
The hills of Andalus ia were only two hours away, but there was 
an entire desert between him and the Pyramids. Yet the boy felt that 
there was another way to regard his situation: he was actually two 
hours closer to his treasure…the fact that the two hours had 
stretched into a n entire year didn’t matter.  
I know why I want to get back to my flock, he thought. I 
understand sheep; they’re no longer a problem, and they can be 
good friends. On the other hand, I don’t know if the desert can be a 
friend, and it’s in the desert that I have to search for my treasure. If I don’t find it, I can always go home. I finally have enough money, and 
all the time I need. Why not?  
He suddenly felt tremendously happy. He could always go back 
to being a shepherd. He could always become a crystal sale sman 
again. Maybe the world had other hidden treasures, but he had a 
dream, and he had met with a king. That doesn’t happen to just 
anyone!  
He was planning as he left the bar. He had remembered that one 
of the crystal merchant’s suppliers transported his c rystal by means 
of caravans that crossed the desert. He held Urim and Thummim in 
his hand; because of those two stones, he was once again on the way 
to his treasure.  
“I am always nearby, when someone wants to realize their 
Personal Legend,” the old king ha d told him.  
What could it cost to go over to the supplier’s warehouse and 
find out if the Pyramids were really that far away?  
 
 
 
THE ENGLISHMAN WAS SITTING ON A BENCH IN A STRUCTURE  that smelled of 
animals, sweat, and dust; it was part warehouse, part corr al. I never 
thought I’d end up in a place like this, he thought, as he leafed 
through the pages of a chemical journal. Ten years at the university, 
and here I am in a corral.  
But he had to move on. He believed in omens. All his life and all 
his studies wer e aimed at finding the one true language of the 
universe. First he had studied Esperanto, then the world’s religions, 
and now it was alchemy. He knew how to speak Esperanto, he 
understood all the major religions well, but he wasn’t yet an 
alchemist. He had  unraveled the truths behind important questions, but his studies had taken him to a point beyond which he could not 
seem to go. He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an 
alchemist. But the alchemists were strange people, who thought 
only ab out themselves, and almost always refused to help him. Who 
knows, maybe they had failed to discover the secret of the Master 
Work —the Philosopher’s Stone —and for this reason kept their 
knowledge to themselves.  
He had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his 
father, fruitlessly seeking the Philosopher’s Stone. He had spent 
enormous amounts of time at the great libraries of the world, and 
had purchased all the rarest and most important volumes on 
alchemy. In one he had read that, many years ago, a  famous Arabian 
alchemist had visited Europe. It was said that he was more than two 
hundred years old, and that he had discovered the Philosopher’s 
Stone and the Elixir of Life. The Englishman had been profoundly 
impressed by the story. But he would never have thought it more 
than just a myth, had not a friend of his —returning from an 
archaeological expedition in the desert —told him about an Arab 
that was possessed of exceptional powers.  
“He lives at the Al -Fayoum oasis,” his friend had said. “And 
people sa y that he is two hundred years old, and is able to 
transform any metal into gold.”  
The Englishman could not contain his excitement. He canceled 
all his commitments and pulled together the most important of his 
books, and now here he was, sitting inside a d usty, smelly 
warehouse. Outside, a huge caravan was being prepared for a 
crossing of the Sahara, and was scheduled to pass through Al -
Fayoum.  
I’m going to find that damned alchemist, the Englishman 
thought. And the odor of the animals became a bit more tol erable.  A young Arab, also loaded down with baggage, entered, and 
greeted the Englishman.  
“Where are you bound?” asked the young Arab.  
“I’m going into the desert,” the man answered, turning back to 
his reading. He didn’t want any conversation at this point. What he 
needed to do was review all he had learned over the years, because 
the alchemist would certainly put him to the test.  
The young Arab took out a book and began to read. The book 
was written in Spanish. That’s good, thought the Englishman. He 
spoke Spanish better than Arabic, and, if this boy was going to Al -
Fayoum, there would be someone to talk to when there were no 
other important things to do.  
 
 
 
“THAT’S STRANGE,” SAID THE BOY, AS HE TRIED ONCE  again to read the 
burial scene that began the book. “I’ve been trying for two years to 
read this book, and I never get past these first few pages.” Even 
without a king to provide an interruption, he was unable to 
concentrate.  
He still had some doubts about the decision he had made. But he 
was able to understand one thing: making a decision was only the 
beginning of things. When someone makes a decision, he is really 
diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had 
never dreamed of when he first made the decision.  
When I decided to seek  out my treasure, I never imagined that 
I’d wind up working in a crystal shop, he thought. And joining this 
caravan may have been my decision, but where it goes is going to be 
a mystery to me.  Nearby was the Englishman, reading a book. He seemed 
unfriendly , and had looked irritated when the boy had entered. 
They might even have become friends, but the Englishman closed 
off the conversation.  
The boy closed his book. He felt that he didn’t want to do 
anything that might make him look like the Englishman. He t ook 
Urim and Thummim from his pocket, and began playing with them.  
The stranger shouted, “Urim and Thummim!”  
In a flash the boy put them back in his pocket.  
“They’re not for sale,” he said.  
“They’re not worth much,” the Englishman answered. “They’re 
only m ade of rock crystal, and there are millions of rock crystals in 
the earth. But those who know about such things would know that 
those are Urim and Thummim. I didn’t know that they had them in 
this part of the world.”  
“They were given to me as a present by a king,” the boy said.  
The stranger didn’t answer; instead, he put his hand in his 
pocket, and took out two stones that were the same as the boy’s.  
“Did you say a king?” he asked.  
“I guess you don’t believe that a king would talk to someone like 
me, a shep herd,” he said, wanting to end the conversation.  
“Not at all. It was shepherds who were the first to recognize a 
king that the rest of the world refused to acknowledge. So, it’s not 
surprising that kings would talk to shepherds.”  
And he went on, fearing th at the boy wouldn’t understand what 
he was talking about, “It’s in the Bible. The same book that taught 
me about Urim and Thummim. These stones were the only form of 
divination permitted by God. The priests carried them in a golden 
breastplate.”  
The boy wa s suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse.  “Maybe this is an omen,” said the Englishman, half aloud.  
“Who told you about omens?” The boy’s interest was increasing 
by the moment.  
“Everything in life is an omen,” said the Englishman, now closing 
the jour nal he was reading. “There is a universal language, 
understood by everybody, but already forgotten. I am in search of 
that universal language, among other things. That’s why I’m here. I 
have to find a man who knows that universal language. An 
alchemist.”  
The conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss.  
“You’re in luck, you two,” the fat Arab said. “There’s a caravan 
leaving today for Al -Fayoum.”  
“But I’m going to Egypt,” the boy said.  
“Al-Fayoum is in Egypt,” said the Arab. “What kind of Arab are 
you?” 
“That’s a good luck omen,” the Englishman said, after the fat 
Arab had gone out. “If I could, I’d write a huge encyclopedia just 
about the words luck and coincidence. It’s with those words that the 
universal language is written.”  
He told the boy it was no coincidence that he had met him with 
Urim and Thummim in his hand. And he asked the boy if he, too, 
were in search of the alchemist.  
“I’m looking for a treasure,” said the boy, and he immediately 
regretted having said it. But the Englishman appeared not  to attach 
any importance to it.  
“In a way, so am I,” he said.  
“I don’t even know what alchemy is,” the boy was saying, when 
the warehouse boss called to them to come outside.  
 
  
“I’M THE LEADER OF THE CARAVAN,” SAID A DARK -EYED,  bearded man. “I 
hold the power of life and death for every person I take with me. 
The desert is a capricious lady, and sometimes she drives men 
crazy.”  
There were almost two hundred people gathered there, and four 
hundred animals —camels, horses, mules, an d fowl. In the crowd 
were women, children, and a number of men with swords at their 
belts and rifles slung on their shoulders. The Englishman had 
several suitcases filled with books. There was a babble of noise, and 
the leader had to repeat himself several  times for everyone to 
understand what he was saying.  
“There are a lot of different people here, and each has his own 
God. But the only God I serve is Allah, and in his name I swear that I 
will do everything possible once again to win out over the desert. 
But I want each and every one of you to swear by the God you 
believe in that you will follow my orders no matter what. In the 
desert, disobedience means death.”  
There was a murmur from the crowd. Each was swearing quietly 
to his or her own God. The boy swo re to Jesus Christ. The 
Englishman said nothing. And the murmur lasted longer than a 
simple vow would have. The people were also praying to heaven for 
protection.  
A long note was sounded on a bugle, and everyone mounted up. 
The boy and the Englishman had b ought camels, and climbed 
uncertainly onto their backs. The boy felt sorry for the Englishman’s 
camel, loaded down as he was with the cases of books.  
“There’s no such thing as coincidence,” said the Englishman, 
picking up the conversation where it had been  interrupted in the warehouse. “I’m here because a friend of mine heard of an Arab 
who…”  
But the caravan began to move, and it was impossible to hear 
what the Englishman was saying. The boy knew what he was about 
to describe, though: the mysterious chain t hat links one thing to 
another, the same chain that had caused him to become a shepherd, 
that had caused his recurring dream, that had brought him to a city 
near Africa, to find a king, and to be robbed in order to meet a 
crystal merchant, and…  
The closer one gets to realizing his Personal Legend, the more 
that Personal Legend becomes his true reason for being, thought the 
boy.  
The caravan moved toward the east. It traveled during the 
morning, halted when the sun was at its strongest, and resumed late 
in th e afternoon. The boy spoke very little with the Englishman, who 
spent most of his time with his books.  
The boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and 
people across the desert. Now everything was quite different from 
how it was that day they ha d set out: then, there had been confusion 
and shouting, the cries of children and the whinnying of animals, all 
mixed with the nervous orders of the guides and the merchants.  
But, in the desert, there was only the sound of the eternal wind, 
and of the hoof beats of the animals. Even the guides spoke very 
little to one another.  
“I’ve crossed these sands many times,” said one of the camel 
drivers one night. “But the desert is so huge, and the horizons so 
distant, that they make a person feel small, and as if h e should 
remain silent.”  The boy understood intuitively what he meant, even without 
ever having set foot in the desert before. Whenever he saw the sea, 
or a fire, he fell silent, impressed by their elemental force.  
I’ve learned things from the sheep, and I ’ve learned things from 
crystal, he thought. I can learn something from the desert, too. It 
seems old and wise.  
The wind never stopped, and the boy remembered the day he 
had sat at the fort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face. 
It reminded him  of the wool from his sheep…his sheep who were 
now seeking food and water in the fields of Andalusia, as they 
always had.  
“They’re not my sheep anymore,” he said to himself, without 
nostalgia. “They must be used to their new shepherd, and have 
probably alr eady forgotten me. That’s good. Creatures like the 
sheep, that are used to traveling, know about moving on.”  
He thought of the merchant’s daughter, and was sure that she 
had probably married. Perhaps to a baker, or to another shepherd 
who could read and could tell her exciting stories —after all, he 
probably wasn’t the only one. But he was excited at his intuitive 
understanding of the camel driver’s comment: maybe he was also 
learning the universal language that deals with the past and the 
present of all p eople. “Hunches,” his mother used to call them. The 
boy was beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden 
immersion of the soul into the universal current of life, where the 
histories of all people are connected, and we are able to know 
everyth ing, because it’s all written there.  
“Maktub,”  the boy said, remembering the crystal merchant.  
The desert was all sand in some stretches, and rocky in others. 
When the caravan was blocked by a boulder, it had to go around it; 
if there was a large rocky are a, they had to make a major detour. If the sand was too fine for the animals’ hooves, they sought a way 
where the sand was more substantial. In some places, the ground 
was covered with the salt of dried -up lakes. The animals balked at 
such places, and the camel drivers were forced to dismount and 
unburden their charges. The drivers carried the freight themselves 
over such treacherous footing, and then reloaded the camels. If a 
guide were to fall ill or die, the camel drivers would draw lots and 
appoint a ne w one.  
But all this happened for one basic reason: no matter how many 
detours and adjustments it made, the caravan moved toward the 
same compass point. Once obstacles were overcome, it returned to 
its course, sighting on a star that indicated the location of the oasis. 
When the people saw that star shining in the morning sky, they 
knew they were on the right course toward water, palm trees, 
shelter, and other people. It was only the Englishman who was 
unaware of all this; he was, for the most part, immersed  in reading 
his books.  
The boy, too, had his book, and he had tried to read it during the 
first few days of the journey. But he found it much more interesting 
to observe the caravan and listen to the wind. As soon as he had 
learned to know his camel better , and to establish a relationship 
with him, he threw the book away. Although the boy had developed 
a superstition that each time he opened the book he would learn 
something important, he decided it was an unnecessary burden.  
He became friendly with the cam el driver who traveled 
alongside him. At night, as they sat around the fire, the boy related 
to the driver his adventures as a shepherd.  
During one of these conversations, the driver told of his own life.  
“I used to live near El Cairum,” he said. “I had my  orchard, my 
children, and a life that would change not at all until I died. One year, when the crop was the best ever, we all went to Mecca, and I 
satisfied the only unmet obligation in my life. I could die happily, 
and that made me feel good.  
“One day, t he earth began to tremble, and the Nile overflowed its 
banks. It was something that I thought could happen only to others, 
never to me. My neighbors feared they would lose all their olive 
trees in the flood, and my wife was afraid that we would lose our 
children. I thought that everything I owned would be destroyed.  
“The land was ruined, and I had to find some other way to earn a 
living. So now I’m a camel driver. But that disaster taught me to 
understand the word of Allah: people need not fear the unknown if 
they are capable of achieving what they need and want.  
“We are afraid of losing what we have, whether it’s our life or 
our possessions and property. But this fear evaporates when we 
understand that our life stories and the history of the world were 
writ ten by the same hand.”  
Sometimes, their caravan met with another. One always had 
something that the other needed —as if everything were indeed 
written by one hand. As they sat around the fire, the camel drivers 
exchanged information about windstorms, and to ld stories about 
the desert.  
At other times, mysterious, hooded men would appear; they 
were Bedouins who did surveillance along the caravan route. They 
provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes. They came 
in silence and departed the same way, dressed in black garments 
that showed only their eyes. One night, a camel driver came to the 
fire where the Englishman and the boy were sitting. “There are 
rumors of tribal wars,” he told them.  The three fell silent. The boy noted that there was a sense of  fear 
in the air, even though no one said anything. Once again he was 
experiencing the language without words…the universal language.  
The Englishman asked if they were in danger.  
“Once you get into the desert, there’s no going back,” said the 
camel driver.  “And, when you can’t go back, you have to worry only 
about the best way of moving forward. The rest is up to Allah, 
including the danger.”  
And he concluded by saying the mysterious word: “Maktub.”  
“You should pay more attention to the caravan,” the boy sa id to 
the Englishman, after the camel driver had left. “We make a lot of 
detours, but we’re always heading for the same destination.”  
“And you ought to read more about the world,” answered the 
Englishman. “Books are like caravans in that respect.”  
The imme nse collection of people and animals began to travel 
faster. The days had always been silent, but now, even the nights —
when the travelers were accustomed to talking around the fires —
had also become quiet. And, one day, the leader of the caravan made 
the de cision that the fires should no longer be lighted, so as not to 
attract attention to the caravan.  
The travelers adopted the practice of arranging the animals in a 
circle at night, sleeping together in the center as protection against 
the nocturnal cold. An d the leader posted armed sentinels at the 
fringes of the group.  
The Englishman was unable to sleep one night. He called to the 
boy, and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the 
encampment. There was a full moon, and the boy told the 
Englishman the  story of his life.  
The Englishman was fascinated with the part about the progress 
achieved at the crystal shop after the boy began working there.  “That’s the principle that governs all things,” he said. “In 
alchemy, it’s called the Soul of the World. When  you want something 
with all your heart, that’s when you are closest to the Soul of the 
World. It’s always a positive force.”  
He also said that this was not just a human gift, that everything 
on the face of the earth had a soul, whether mineral, vegetable,  or 
animal —or even just a simple thought.  
“Everything on earth is being continuously transformed, because 
the earth is alive…and it has a soul. We are part of that soul, so we 
rarely recognize that it is working for us. But in the crystal shop you 
probably  realized that even the glasses were collaborating in your 
success.”  
The boy thought about that for a while as he looked at the moon 
and the bleached sands. “I have watched the caravan as it crossed 
the desert,” he said. “The caravan and the desert speak t he same 
language, and it’s for that reason that the desert allows the crossing. 
It’s going to test the caravan’s every step to see if it’s in time, and, if 
it is, we will make it to the oasis.”  
“If either of us had joined this caravan based only on persona l 
courage, but without understanding that language, this journey 
would have been much more difficult.”  
They stood there looking at the moon.  
“That’s the magic of omens,” said the boy. “I’ve seen how the 
guides read the signs of the desert, and how the soul  of the caravan 
speaks to the soul of the desert.”  
The Englishman said, “I’d better pay more attention to the 
caravan.”  
“And I’d better read your books,” said the boy.  
 
  
THEY WERE STRANGE BOOKS . THEY SPOKE ABOUT MERCURY , salt, dragons, 
and kings, and he d idn’t understand any of it. But there was one idea 
that seemed to repeat itself throughout all the books: all things are 
the manifestation of one thing only.  
In one of the books he learned that the most important text in 
the literature of alchemy contained  only a few lines, and had been 
inscribed on the surface of an emerald.  
“It’s the Emerald Tablet,” said the Englishman, proud that he 
might teach something to the boy.  
“Well, then, why do we need all these books?” the boy asked.  
“So that we can understand those few lines,” the Englishman 
answered, without appearing really to believe what he had said.  
The book that most interested the boy told the stories of the 
famous alchemists. They were men who had dedicated their entire 
lives to the purification of meta ls in their laboratories; they believed 
that, if a metal were heated for many years, it would free itself of all 
its individual properties, and what was left would be the Soul of the 
World. This Soul of the World allowed them to understand anything 
on the face of the earth, because it was the language with which all 
things communicated. They called that discovery the Master 
Work —it was part liquid and part solid.  
“Can’t you just observe men and omens in order to understand 
the language?” the boy asked.  
“You  have a mania for simplifying everything,” answered the 
Englishman, irritated. “Alchemy is a serious discipline. Every step 
has to be followed exactly as it was followed by the masters.”  
The boy learned that the liquid part of the Master Work was 
called th e Elixir of Life, and that it cured all illnesses; it also kept the alchemist from growing old. And the solid part was called the 
Philosopher’s Stone.  
“It’s not easy to find the Philosopher’s Stone,” said the 
Englishman. “The alchemists spent years in thei r laboratories, 
observing the fire that purified the metals. They spent so much time 
close to the fire that gradually they gave up the vanities of the 
world. They discovered that the purification of the metals had led to 
a purification of themselves.”  
The boy thought about the crystal merchant. He had said that it 
was a good thing for the boy to clean the crystal pieces, so that he 
could free himself from negative thoughts. The boy was becoming 
more and more convinced that alchemy could be learned in one’s 
daily life.  
“Also,” said the Englishman, “the Philosopher’s Stone has a 
fascinating property. A small sliver of the stone can transform large 
quantities of metal into gold.”  
Having heard that, the boy became even more interested in 
alchemy. He thought that , with some patience, he’d be able to 
transform everything into gold. He read the lives of the various 
people who had succeeded in doing so: Helvétius, Elias, Fulcanelli, 
and Geber. They were fascinating stories: each of them lived out his 
Personal Legend to the end. They traveled, spoke with wise men, 
performed miracles for the incredulous, and owned the 
Philosopher’s Stone and the Elixir of Life.  
But when the boy wanted to learn how to achieve the Master 
Work, he became completely lost. There were just dr awings, coded 
instructions, and obscure texts.  
 
 
 “W HY DO THEY MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED?” HE  asked the Englishman 
one night. The boy had noticed that the Englishman was irritable, 
and missed his books.  
“So that those who have the responsibility for understanding can 
understand,” he said. “Imagine if everyone went around 
transforming lead into gold. Gold would lose its value.  
“It’s only those who are persistent, and willing to study things 
deeply, who achieve the Master Work. That’s why I’m here in th e 
middle of the desert. I’m seeking a true alchemist who will help me 
to decipher the codes.”  
“When were these books written?” the boy asked.  
“Many centuries ago.”  
“They didn’t have the printing press in those days,” the boy 
argued. “There was no way for e verybody to know about alchemy. 
Why did they use such strange language, with so many drawings?”  
The Englishman didn’t answer him directly. He said that for the 
past few days he had been paying attention to how the caravan 
operated, but that he hadn’t learn ed anything new. The only thing 
he had noticed was that talk of war was becoming more and more 
frequent.  
 
 
 
THEN ONE DAY THE BOY RETURNED THE BOOKS TO THE  Englishman. “Did 
you learn anything?” the Englishman asked, eager to hear what it 
might be. He needed  someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking 
about the possibility of war.  
“I learned that the world has a soul, and that whoever 
understands that soul can also understand the language of things. I 
learned that many alchemists realized their Personal Legend s, and wound up discovering the Soul of the World, the Philosopher’s 
Stone, and the Elixir of Life.  
“But, above all, I learned that these things are all so simple that 
they could be written on the surface of an emerald.”  
The Englishman was disappointed. Th e years of research, the 
magic symbols, the strange words, and the laboratory 
equipment…none of this had made an impression on the boy. His 
soul must be too primitive to understand those things, he thought.  
He took back his books and packed them away again  in their 
bags.  
“Go back to watching the caravan,” he said. “That didn’t teach me 
anything, either.”  
The boy went back to contemplating the silence of the desert, 
and the sand raised by the animals. “Everyone has his or her own 
way of learning things,” he said to himself. “His way isn’t the same 
as mine, nor mine as his. But we’re both in search of our Personal 
Legends, and I respect him for that.”  
 
 
 
THE CARAVAN BEGAN TO TRAVEL DAY AND NIGHT . THE hooded Bedouins 
reappeared more and more frequently, and the camel driver —who 
had become a good friend of the boy’s —explained that the war 
between the tribes had already begun. The caravan would be very 
lucky to reach the oasis.  
The animals were exhausted , and the men talked among 
themselves less and less. The silence was the worst aspect of the 
night, when the mere groan of a camel —which before had been 
nothing but the groan of a camel —now frightened everyone, 
because it might signal a raid.  The camel dri ver, though, seemed not to be very concerned with 
the threat of war.  
“I’m alive,” he said to the boy, as they ate a bunch of dates one 
night, with no fires and no moon. “When I’m eating, that’s all I think 
about. If I’m on the march, I just concentrate on marching. If I have 
to fight, it will be just as good a day to die as any other.  
“Because I don’t live in either my past or my future. I’m 
interested only in the present. If you can concentrate always on the 
present, you’ll be a happy man. You’ll see that there is life in the 
desert, that there are stars in the heavens, and that tribesmen fight 
because they are part of the human race. Life will be a party for you, 
a grand festival, because life is the moment we’re living right now.”  
Two nights later, as he was getting ready to bed down, the boy 
looked for the star they followed every night. He thought that the 
horizon was a bit lower than it had been, because he seemed to see 
stars on the desert itself.  
“It’s the oasis,” said the camel driver.  
“Well, why don ’t we go there right now?” the boy asked.  
“Because we have to sleep.”  
 
 
 
THE BOY AWOKE AS THE SUN ROSE . T HERE, IN FRONT OF  him, where the 
small stars had been the night before, was an endless row of date 
palms, stretching across the entire desert.  
“We’ve d one it!” said the Englishman, who had also awakened 
early.  
But the boy was quiet. He was at home with the silence of the 
desert, and he was content just to look at the trees. He still had a 
long way to go to reach the Pyramids, and someday this morning wou ld just be a memory. But this was the present moment —the 
party the camel driver had mentioned —and he wanted to live it as 
he did the lessons of his past and his dreams of the future. Although 
the vision of the date palms would someday be just a memory, rig ht 
now it signified shade, water, and a refuge from the war. Yesterday, 
the camel’s groan signaled danger, and now a row of date palms 
could herald a miracle.  
The world speaks many languages, the boy thought.  
 
 
 
THE TIMES RUSH PAST, AND SO DO THE CARAVANS,  thought the alchemist, 
as he watched the hundreds of people and animals arriving at the 
oasis. People were shouting at the new arrivals, dust obscured the 
desert sun, and the children of the oasis were bursting with 
excitement at the arrival of the strang ers. The alchemist saw the 
tribal chiefs greet the leader of the caravan, and converse with him 
at length.  
But none of that mattered to the alchemist. He had already seen 
many people come and go, and the desert remained as it was. He 
had seen kings and beg gars walking the desert sands. The dunes 
were changed constantly by the wind, yet these were the same 
sands he had known since he was a child. He always enjoyed seeing 
the happiness that the travelers experienced when, after weeks of 
yellow sand and blue s ky, they first saw the green of the date palms. 
Maybe God created the desert so that man could appreciate the date 
trees, he thought.  
He decided to concentrate on more practical matters. He knew 
that in the caravan there was a man to whom he was to teach s ome 
of his secrets. The omens had told him so. He didn’t know the man yet, but his practiced eye would recognize him when he appeared. 
He hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous 
apprentice.  
I don’t know why these things have to be transmi tted by word of 
mouth, he thought. It wasn’t exactly that they were secrets; God 
revealed his secrets easily to all his creatures.  
He had only one explanation for this fact: things have to be 
transmitted this way because they were made up from the pure lif e, 
and this kind of life cannot be captured in pictures or words.  
Because people become fascinated with pictures and words, and 
wind up forgetting the Language of the World.  
 
 
 
THE BOY COULDN’T BELIEVE WHAT HE WAS SEEING: THE  oasis, rather than 
being just a well surrounded by a few palm trees —as he had seen 
once in a geography book —was much larger than many towns back 
in Spain. There were three hundred wells, fifty thousand date trees, 
and innumerable colored tents spread amon g them.  
“It looks like A Thousand and One Nights, ” said the Englishman, 
impatient to meet with the alchemist.  
They were surrounded by children, curious to look at the 
animals and people that were arriving. The men of the oasis wanted 
to know if they had se en any fighting, and the women competed 
with one another for access to the cloth and precious stones 
brought by the merchants. The silence of the desert was a distant 
dream; the travelers in the caravan were talking incessantly, 
laughing and shouting, as i f they had emerged from the spiritual 
world and found themselves once again in the world of people. They 
were relieved and happy.  They had been taking careful precautions in the desert, but the 
camel driver explained to the boy that oases were always 
consi dered to be neutral territories, because the majority of the 
inhabitants were women and children. There were oases 
throughout the desert, but the tribesmen fought in the desert, 
leaving the oases as places of refuge.  
With some difficulty, the leader of the  caravan brought all his 
people together and gave them his instructions. The group was to 
remain there at the oasis until the conflict between the tribes was 
over. Since they were visitors, they would have to share living space 
with those who lived there, and would be given the best 
accommodations. That was the law of hospitality. Then he asked 
that everyone, including his own sentinels, hand over their arms to 
the men appointed by the tribal chieftains.  
“Those are the rules of war,” the leader explained. “ The oases 
may not shelter armies or troops.”  
To the boy’s surprise, the Englishman took a chrome -plated 
revolver out of his bag and gave it to the men who were collecting 
the arms.  
“Why a revolver?” he asked.  
“It helped me to trust in people,” the Englishman answered.  
Meanwhile, the boy thought about his treasure. The closer he got 
to the realization of his dream, the more difficult things became. It 
seemed as if what the old king had called “beginner’s luck” were no 
longer functioning. In his pursu it of the dream, he was being 
constantly subjected to tests of his persistence and courage. So he 
could not be hasty, nor impatient. If he pushed forward impulsively, 
he would fail to see the signs and omens left by God along his path.  
God placed them alon g my path. He had surprised himself with 
the thought. Until then, he had considered the omens to be things of this world. Like eating or sleeping, or like seeking love or finding a 
job. He had never thought of them in terms of a language used by 
God to ind icate what he should do.  
“Don’t be impatient,” he repeated to himself. “It’s like the camel 
driver said: ‘Eat when it’s time to eat. And move along when it’s 
time to move along.’”  
That first day, everyone slept from exhaustion, including the 
Englishman. Th e boy was assigned a place far from his friend, in a 
tent with five other young men of about his age. They were people 
of the desert, and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities.  
The boy told them about his life as a shepherd, and was about to 
tell them of his experiences at the crystal shop when the 
Englishman came into the tent.  
“I’ve been looking for you all morning,” he said, as he led the boy 
outside. “I need you to help me find out where the alchemist lives.”  
First, they tried to find him on their own. An alchemist would 
probably live in a manner that was different from that of the rest of 
the people at the oasis, and it was likely that in his tent an oven was 
continuously burning. They searched everywhere, and found that 
the oasis was much  larger than they could have imagined; there 
were hundreds of tents.  
“We’ve wasted almost the entire day,” said the Englishman, 
sitting down with the boy near one of the wells.  
“Maybe we’d better ask someone,” the boy suggested.  
The Englishman didn’t want to tell others about his reasons for 
being at the oasis, and couldn’t make up his mind. But, finally, he 
agreed that the boy, who spoke better Arabic than he, should do so. 
The boy approached a woman who had come to the well to fill a 
goatskin with water.  “Good afternoon, ma’am. I’m trying to find out where the 
alchemist lives here at the oasis.”  
The woman said she had never heard of such a person, and 
hurried away. But before she fled, she advised the boy that he had 
better not try to converse with women w ho were dressed in black, 
because they were married women. He should respect tradition.  
The Englishman was disappointed. It seemed he had made the 
long journey for nothing. The boy was also saddened; his friend was 
in pursuit of his Personal Legend. And, w hen someone was in such 
pursuit, the entire universe made an effort to help him succeed —
that’s what the old king had said. He couldn’t have been wrong.  
“I had never heard of alchemists before,” the boy said. “Maybe 
no one here has, either.”  
The Englishman’ s eyes lit up. “That’s it! Maybe no one here 
knows what an alchemist is! Find out who it is who cures the 
people’s illnesses!”  
Several women dressed in black came to the well for water, but 
the boy would speak to none of them, despite the Englishman’s 
insistence. Then a man approached.  
“Do you know someone here who cures people’s illnesses?” the 
boy asked.  
“Allah cures our illnesses,” said the man, clearly frightened of the 
strangers. “You’re looking for witch doctors.” He spoke some verses 
from the Koran, and moved on.  
Another man appeared. He was older, and was carrying a small 
bucket. The boy repeated his question.  
“Why do you want to find that sort of person?” the Arab asked.  
“Because my friend here has traveled for many months in order 
to meet with him,” the boy said.  “If such a man is here at the oasis, he must be the very powerful 
one,” said the old man after thinking for a few moments. “Not even 
the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to. Only 
when he consents.  
“Wait for the end o f the war. Then leave with the caravan. Don’t 
try to enter into the life of the oasis,” he said, and walked away.  
But the Englishman was exultant. They were on the right track.  
Finally, a young woman approached who was not dressed in 
black. She had a vesse l on her shoulder, and her head was covered 
by a veil, but her face was uncovered. The boy approached her to 
ask about the alchemist.  
At that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the 
Soul of the World surged within him. When he looked into h er dark 
eyes, and saw that her lips were poised between a laugh and silence, 
he learned the most important part of the language that all the 
world spoke —the language that everyone on earth was capable of 
understanding in their heart. It was love. Something  older than 
humanity, more ancient than the desert. Something that exerted the 
same force whenever two pairs of eyes met, as had theirs here at 
the well. She smiled, and that was certainly an omen —the omen he 
had been awaiting, without even knowing he was,  for all his life. The 
omen he had sought to find with his sheep and in his books, in the 
crystals and in the silence of the desert.  
It was the pure Language of the World. It required no 
explanation, just as the universe needs none as it travels through 
endless time. What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in 
the presence of the only woman in his life, and that, with no need for 
words, she recognized the same thing. He was more certain of it 
than of anything in the world. He had been told by his pa rents and 
grandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person before becoming committed. But maybe people who felt that way 
had never learned the universal language. Because, when you know 
that language, it’s easy to understand that someone in the world 
awaits you, whether it’s in the middle of the desert or in some great 
city. And when two such people encounter each other, and their 
eyes meet, the past and the future become unimportant. There is 
only that moment, and the incredible certainty th at everything 
under the sun has been written by one hand only. It is the hand that 
evokes love, and creates a twin soul for every person in the world. 
Without such love, one’s dreams would have no meaning.  
Maktub,  thought the boy.  
The Englishman shook the boy: “Come on, ask her!”  
The boy stepped closer to the girl, and when she smiled, he did 
the same.  
“What’s your name?” he asked.  
“Fatima,” the girl said, averting her eyes.  
“That’s what some women in my country are called.”  
“It’s the name of the Prophet’s daughter,” Fatima said. “The 
invaders carried the name everywhere.” The beautiful girl spoke of 
the invaders with pride.  
The Englishman prodded him, and the boy asked her about the 
man who cured people’s illnesses.  
“That’s the man who knows all the secrets  of the world,” she 
said. “He communicates with the genies of the desert.”  
The genies were the spirits of good and evil. And the girl pointed 
to the south, indicating that it was there the strange man lived. Then 
she filled her vessel with water and left.  
The Englishman vanished, too, gone to find the alchemist. And 
the boy sat there by the well for a long time, remembering that one 
day in Tarifa the levanter had brought to him the perfume of that woman, and realizing that he had loved her before he even kn ew 
she existed. He knew that his love for her would enable him to 
discover every treasure in the world.  
The next day, the boy returned to the well, hoping to see the girl. 
To his surprise, the Englishman was there, looking out at the desert.  
“I waited all afternoon and evening,” he said. “He appeared with 
the first stars of evening. I told him what I was seeking, and he 
asked me if I had ever transformed lead into gold. I told him that 
was what I had come here to learn.  
“He told me I should try to do so. Th at’s all he said: ‘Go and try.’”  
The boy didn’t say anything. The poor Englishman had traveled 
all this way, only to be told that he should repeat what he had 
already done so many times.  
“So, then try,” he said to the Englishman.  
“That’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to start now.”  
As the Englishman left, Fatima arrived and filled her vessel with 
water.  
“I came to tell you just one thing,” the boy said. “I want you to be 
my wife. I love you.”  
The girl dropped the container, and the water spilled.  
“I’m going to wait here for you every day. I have crossed the 
desert in search of a treasure that is somewhere near the Pyramids, 
and for me, the war seemed a curse. But now it’s a blessing, because 
it brought me to you.”  
“The war is going to end someday,” the girl said.  
The boy looked around him at the date palms. He reminded 
himself that he had been a shepherd, and that he could be a 
shepherd again. Fatima was more important than his treasure.  “The tribesmen are always in search of treasure,” the girl said, as  
if she had guessed what he was thinking. “And the women of the 
desert are proud of their tribesmen.”  
She refilled her vessel and left.  
The boy went to the well every day to meet with Fatima. He told 
her about his life as a shepherd, about the king, and ab out the 
crystal shop. They became friends, and except for the fifteen 
minutes he spent with her, each day seemed that it would never 
pass. When he had been at the oasis for almost a month, the leader 
of the caravan called a meeting of all of the people tra veling with 
him.  
“We don’t know when the war will end, so we can’t continue our 
journey,” he said. “The battles may last for a long time, perhaps even 
years. There are powerful forces on both sides, and the war is 
important to both armies. It’s not a battl e of good against evil. It’s a 
war between forces that are fighting for the balance of power, and, 
when that type of battle begins, it lasts longer than others —because 
Allah is on both sides.”  
The people went back to where they were living, and the boy 
wen t to meet with Fatima that afternoon. He told her about the 
morning’s meeting. “The day after we met,” Fatima said, “you told 
me that you loved me. Then, you taught me something of the 
universal language and the Soul of the World. Because of that, I have 
become a part of you.”  
The boy listened to the sound of her voice, and thought it to be 
more beautiful than the sound of the wind in the date palms.  
“I have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time. I 
have forgotten about my past, about my tr aditions, and the way in 
which men of the desert expect women to behave. Ever since I was a child, I have dreamed that the desert would bring me a wonderful 
present. Now, my present has arrived, and it’s you.”  
The boy wanted to take her hand. But Fatima’s hands held to the 
handles of her jug.  
“You have told me about your dreams, about the old king and 
your treasure. And you’ve told me about omens. So now, I fear 
nothing, because it was those omens that brought you to me. And I 
am a part of your dream, a par t of your Personal Legend, as you call 
it. 
“That’s why I want you to continue toward your goal. If you have 
to wait until the war is over, then wait. But if you have to go before 
then, go on in pursuit of your dream. The dunes are changed by the 
wind, but the desert never changes. That’s the way it will be with 
our love for each other.  
“Maktub,”  she said. “If I am really a part of your dream, you’ll 
come back one day.”  
The boy was sad as he left her that day. He thought of all the 
married shepherds he had k nown. They had a difficult time 
convincing their wives that they had to go off into distant fields. 
Love required them to stay with the people they loved.  
He told Fatima that, at their next meeting.  
“The desert takes our men from us, and they don’t always 
return,” she said. “We know that, and we are used to it. Those who 
don’t return become a part of the clouds, a part of the animals that 
hide in the ravines and of the water that comes from the earth. They 
become a part of everything…they become the Soul of  the World.  
“Some do come back. And then the other women are happy 
because they believe that their men may one day return, as well. I 
used to look at those women and envy them their happiness. Now, I 
too will be one of the women who wait.  “I’m a desert wom an, and I’m proud of that. I want my husband 
to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes. And, if I have 
to, I will accept the fact that he has become a part of the clouds, and 
the animals, and the water of the desert.”  
The boy went to look for the  Englishman. He wanted to tell him 
about Fatima. He was surprised when he saw that the Englishman 
had built himself a furnace outside his tent. It was a strange furnace, 
fueled by firewood, with a transparent flask heating on top. As the 
Englishman stared out at the desert, his eyes seemed brighter than 
they had when he was reading his books.  
“This is the first phase of the job,” he said. “I have to separate out 
the sulfur. To do that successfully, I must have no fear of failure. It 
was my fear of failure t hat first kept me from attempting the Master 
Work. Now, I’m beginning what I could have started ten years ago. 
But I’m happy at least that I didn’t wait twenty years.”  
He continued to feed the fire, and the boy stayed on until the 
desert turned pink in the  setting sun. He felt the urge to go out into 
the desert, to see if its silence held the answers to his questions.  
He wandered for a while, keeping the date palms of the oasis 
within sight. He listened to the wind, and felt the stones beneath his 
feet. Her e and there, he found a shell, and realized that the desert, in 
remote times, had been a sea. He sat on a stone, and allowed himself 
to become hypnotized by the horizon. He tried to deal with the 
concept of love as distinct from possession, and couldn’t se parate 
them. But Fatima was a woman of the desert, and, if anything could 
help him to understand, it was the desert.  
As he sat there thinking, he sensed movement above him. 
Looking up, he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky.  
He watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind. Although 
their flight appeared to have no pattern, it made a certain kind of sense to the boy. It was just that he couldn’t grasp what it meant. He 
followed the movement of the birds, trying to read something into 
it. Maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of 
love without ownership.  
He felt sleepy. In his heart, he wanted to remain awake, but he 
also wanted to sleep. “I am learning the Language of the World, and 
everything in the world is beginning to make sense to me…even the 
flight of the hawks,” he said to himself. And, in that mood, he was 
grateful to be in love. When you are in love, things make even more 
sense, he thought.  
Suddenly, one of the hawks made a flashing dive through the 
sky, attacking the other. As it did so, a sudden, fleeting image came 
to the boy: an army, with its swords at the ready, riding into the 
oasis. The vision vanished immediately, but it had shaken him. He 
had heard people speak of mirages, and had already seen some 
himself: they were  desires that, because of their intensity, 
materialized over the sands of the desert. But he certainly didn’t 
desire that an army invade the oasis.  
He wanted to forget about the vision, and return to his 
meditation. He tried again to concentrate on the pin k shades of the 
desert, and its stones. But there was something there in his heart 
that wouldn’t allow him to do so.  
“Always heed the omens,” the old king had said. The boy recalled 
what he had seen in the vision, and sensed that it was actually going 
to occur.  
He rose, and made his way back toward the palm trees. Once 
again, he perceived the many languages in the things about him: this 
time, the desert was safe, and it was the oasis that had become 
dangerous.  The camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree, 
observing the sunset. He saw the boy appear from the other side of 
the dunes.  
“An army is coming,” the boy said. “I had a vision.”  
“The desert fills men’s hearts with visions,” the camel driver 
answered.  
But the boy told him about the hawks: tha t he had been 
watching their flight and had suddenly felt himself to have plunged 
to the Soul of the World.  
The camel driver understood what the boy was saying. He knew 
that any given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history 
of all things. O ne could open a book to any page, or look at a 
person’s hand; one could turn a card, or watch the flight of the 
birds…whatever the thing observed, one could find a connection 
with his experience of the moment. Actually, it wasn’t that those 
things, in them selves, revealed anything at all; it was just that 
people, looking at what was occurring around them, could find a 
means of penetration to the Soul of the World.  
The desert was full of men who earned their living based on the 
ease with which they could pen etrate to the Soul of the World. They 
were known as seers, and they were held in fear by women and the 
elderly. Tribesmen were also wary of consulting them, because it 
would be impossible to be effective in battle if one knew that he was 
fated to die. The tribesmen preferred the taste of battle, and the 
thrill of not knowing what the outcome would be; the future was 
already written by Allah, and what he had written was always for 
the good of man. So the tribesmen lived only for the present, 
because the pres ent was full of surprises, and they had to be aware 
of many things: Where was the enemy’s sword? Where was his 
horse? What kind of blow should one deliver next in order to remain alive? The camel driver was not a fighter, and he had 
consulted with seers. M any of them had been right about what they 
said, while some had been wrong. Then, one day, the oldest seer he 
had ever sought out (and the one most to be feared) had asked why 
the camel driver was so interested in the future.  
“Well…so I can do things,” he had responded. “And so I can 
change those things that I don’t want to happen.”  
“But then they wouldn’t be a part of your future,” the seer had 
said.  
“Well, maybe I just want to know the future so I can prepare 
myself for what’s coming.”  
“If good things are  coming, they will be a pleasant surprise,” said 
the seer. “If bad things are, and you know in advance, you will suffer 
greatly before they even occur.”  
“I want to know about the future because I’m a man,” the camel 
driver had said to the seer. “And men al ways live their lives based 
on the future.”  
The seer was a specialist in the casting of twigs; he threw them 
on the ground, and made interpretations based on how they fell. 
That day, he didn’t make a cast. He wrapped the twigs in a piece of 
cloth and put t hem back in his bag.  
“I make my living forecasting the future for people,” he said. “I 
know the science of the twigs, and I know how to use them to 
penetrate to the place where all is written. There, I can read the 
past, discover what has already been forg otten, and understand the 
omens that are here in the present.  
“When people consult me, it’s not that I’m reading the future; I 
am guessing at the future. The future belongs to God, and it is only 
he who reveals it, under extraordinary circumstances. How do  I 
guess at the future? Based on the omens of the present. The secret is here in the present. If you pay attention to the present, you can 
improve upon it. And, if you improve on the present, what comes 
later will also be better. Forget about the future, a nd live each day 
according to the teachings, confident that God loves his children. 
Each day, in itself, brings with it an eternity.”  
The camel driver had asked what the circumstances were under 
which God would allow him to see the future.  
“Only when he, h imself, reveals it. And God only rarely reveals 
the future. When he does so, it is for only one reason: it’s a future 
that was written so as to be altered.”  
God had shown the boy a part of the future, the camel driver 
thought. Why was it that he wanted the  boy to serve as his 
instrument?  
“Go and speak to the tribal chieftains,” said the camel driver. 
“Tell them about the armies that are approaching.”  
“They’ll laugh at me.”  
“They are men of the desert, and the men of the desert are used 
to dealing with omens.”  
“Well, then, they probably already know.”  
“They’re not concerned with that right now. They believe that if 
they have to know about something Allah wants them to know, 
someone will tell them about it. It has happened many times before. 
But, this tim e, the person is you.”  
The boy thought of Fatima. And he decided he would go to see 
the chiefs of the tribes.  
 
 
 
THE BOY APPROACHED THE GUARD AT THE FRONT OF THE  huge white tent at 
the center of the oasis.  “I want to see the chieftains. I’ve brought omens from the 
desert.”  
Without responding, the guard entered the tent, where he 
remained for some time. When he emerged, it was with a young 
Arab, dressed in white and gold. The boy told the younger man what 
he had seen, and the man asked him to wait there. He disappeared 
into the tent.  
Night fell, and an assortment of fighting men and merchants 
entered and exited the tent. One by one, the campfires were 
extinguished, and the oasis fell as quiet as the desert. Only the lights 
in the great tent remained. During a ll this time, the boy thought 
about Fatima, and he was still unable to understand his last 
conversation with her.  
Finally, after hours of waiting, the guard bade the boy enter. The 
boy was astonished by what he saw inside. Never could he have 
imagined that , there in the middle of the desert, there existed a tent 
like this one. The ground was covered with the most beautiful 
carpets he had ever walked upon, and from the top of the structure 
hung lamps of handwrought gold, each with a lighted candle. The 
triba l chieftains were seated at the back of the tent in a semicircle, 
resting upon richly embroidered silk cushions. Servants came and 
went with silver trays laden with spices and tea. Other servants 
maintained the fires in the hookahs. The atmosphere was suff used 
with the sweet scent of smoke.  
There were eight chieftains, but the boy could see immediately 
which of them was the most important: an Arab dressed in white 
and gold, seated at the center of the semicircle. At his side was the 
young Arab the boy had s poken with earlier.  
“Who is this stranger who speaks of omens?” asked one of the 
chieftains, eyeing the boy.  “It is I,” the boy answered. And he told what he had seen.  
“Why would the desert reveal such things to a stranger, when it 
knows that we have been here for generations?” said another of the 
chieftains.  
“Because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert,” the boy 
said. “I can see things that eyes habituated to the desert might not 
see.”  
And also because I know about the Soul of the World, he though t 
to himself.  
“The oasis is neutral ground. No one attacks an oasis,” said a 
third chieftain.  
“I can only tell you what I saw. If you don’t want to believe me, 
you don’t have to do anything about it.”  
The men fell into an animated discussion. They spoke in  an 
Arabic dialect that the boy didn’t understand, but, when he made to 
leave, the guard told him to stay. The boy became fearful; the omens 
told him that something was wrong. He regretted having spoken to 
the camel driver about what he had seen in the des ert. 
Suddenly, the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly, 
and the boy felt better. The man hadn’t participated in the 
discussion, and, in fact, hadn’t said a word up to that point. But the 
boy was already used to the Language of the World, and he  could 
feel the vibrations of peace throughout the tent. Now his intuition 
was that he had been right in coming.  
The discussion ended. The chieftains were silent for a few 
moments as they listened to what the old man was saying. Then he 
turned to the boy: this time his expression was cold and distant.  
“Two thousand years ago, in a distant land, a man who believed 
in dreams was thrown into a dungeon and then sold as a slave,” the 
old man said, now in the dialect the boy understood. “Our merchants bought that  man, and brought him to Egypt. All of us 
know that whoever believes in dreams also knows how to interpret 
them.”  
The elder continued, “When the pharaoh dreamed of cows that 
were thin and cows that were fat, this man I’m speaking of rescued 
Egypt from fami ne. His name was Joseph. He, too, was a stranger in 
a strange land, like you, and he was probably about your age.”  
He paused, and his eyes were still unfriendly.  
“We always observe the Tradition. The Tradition saved Egypt 
from famine in those days, and mad e the Egyptians the wealthiest of 
peoples. The Tradition teaches men how to cross the desert, and 
how their children should marry. The Tradition says that an oasis is 
neutral territory, because both sides have oases, and so both are 
vulnerable.”  
No one sai d a word as the old man continued.  
“But the Tradition also says that we should believe the messages 
of the desert. Everything we know was taught to us by the desert.”  
The old man gave a signal, and everyone stood. The meeting was 
over. The hookahs were ext inguished, and the guards stood at 
attention. The boy made ready to leave, but the old man spoke 
again:  
“Tomorrow, we are going to break the agreement that says that 
no one at the oasis may carry arms. Throughout the entire day we 
will be on the lookout fo r our enemies. When the sun sets, the men 
will once again surrender their arms to me. For every ten dead men 
among our enemies, you will receive a piece of gold.  
“But arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle. Arms 
are as capricious as the deser t, and, if they are not used, the next 
time they might not function. If at least one of them hasn’t been 
used by the end of the day tomorrow, one will be used on you.”  When the boy left the tent, the oasis was illuminated only by the 
light of the full moon . He was twenty minutes from his tent, and 
began to make his way there.  
He was alarmed by what had happened. He had succeeded in 
reaching through to the Soul of the World, and now the price for 
having done so might be his life. It was a frightening bet. Bu t he had 
been making risky bets ever since the day he had sold his sheep to 
pursue his Personal Legend. And, as the camel driver had said, to 
die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day. Every day 
was there to be lived or to mark one’s departure from this world. 
Everything depended on one word: “Maktub.”  
Walking along in the silence, he had no regrets. If he died 
tomorrow, it would be because God was not willing to change the 
future. He would at least have died after having crossed the strait, 
after having worked in a crystal shop, and after having known the 
silence of the desert and Fatima’s eyes. He had lived every one of his 
days intensely since he had left home so long ago. If he died 
tomorrow, he would already have seen more than other shepher ds, 
and he was proud of that.  
Suddenly he heard a thundering sound, and he was thrown to 
the ground by a wind such as he had never known. The area was 
swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view. Before 
him was an enormous white horse, reari ng over him with a 
frightening scream.  
When the blinding dust had settled a bit, the boy trembled at 
what he saw. Astride the animal was a horseman dressed 
completely in black, with a falcon perched on his left shoulder. He 
wore a turban and his entire fac e, except for his eyes, was covered 
with a black kerchief. He appeared to be a messenger from the desert, but his presence was much more powerful than that of a 
mere messenger.  
The strange horseman drew an enormous, curved sword from a 
scabbard mounted on his saddle. The steel of its blade glittered in 
the light of the moon.  
“Who dares to read the meaning of the flight of the hawks?” he 
demanded, so loudly that his words seemed to echo through the 
fifty thousand palm trees of Al -Fayoum.  
“It is I who dared to do so,” said the boy. He was reminded of the 
image of Santiago Matamoros, mounted on his white horse, with the 
infidels beneath his hooves. This man looked exactly the same, 
except that now the roles were reversed.  
“It is I who dared to do so,” he repea ted, and he lowered his head 
to receive a blow from the sword. “Many lives will be saved, because 
I was able to see through to the Soul of the World.”  
The sword didn’t fall. Instead, the stranger lowered it slowly, 
until the point touched the boy’s forehea d. It drew a droplet of 
blood.  
The horseman was completely immobile, as was the boy. It 
didn’t even occur to the boy to flee. In his heart, he felt a strange 
sense of joy: he was about to die in pursuit of his Personal Legend. 
And for Fatima. The omens had  been true, after all. Here he was, 
face -to-face with his enemy, but there was no need to be concerned 
about dying —the Soul of the World awaited him, and he would soon 
be a part of it. And, tomorrow, his enemy would also be a part of 
that Soul.  
The strange r continued to hold the sword at the boy’s forehead. 
“Why did you read the flight of the birds?”  “I read only what the birds wanted to tell me. They wanted to 
save the oasis. Tomorrow all of you will die, because there are more 
men at the oasis than you ha ve.” 
The sword remained where it was. “Who are you to change what 
Allah has willed?”  
“Allah created the armies, and he also created the hawks. Allah 
taught me the language of the birds. Everything has been written by 
the same hand,” the boy said, rememberi ng the camel driver’s 
words.  
The stranger withdrew the sword from the boy’s forehead, and 
the boy felt immensely relieved. But he still couldn’t flee.  
“Be careful with your prognostications,” said the stranger. 
“When something is written, there is no way to change it.”  
“All I saw was an army,” said the boy. “I didn’t see the outcome 
of the battle.”  
The stranger seemed satisfied with the answer. But he kept the 
sword in his hand. “What is a stranger doing in a strange land?”  
“I am following my Personal Lege nd. It’s not something you 
would understand.”  
The stranger placed his sword in its scabbard, and the boy 
relaxed.  
“I had to test your courage,” the stranger said. “Courage is the 
quality most essential to understanding the Language of the World.”  
The boy w as surprised. The stranger was speaking of things that 
very few people knew about.  
“You must not let up, even after having come so far,” he 
continued. “You must love the desert, but never trust it completely. 
Because the desert tests all men: it challenges  every step, and kills 
those who become distracted.”  
What he said reminded the boy of the old king.  “If the warriors come here, and your head is still on your 
shoulders at sunset, come and find me,” said the stranger.  
The same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip. 
The horse reared again, raising a cloud of dust.  
“Where do you live?” shouted the boy, as the horseman rode 
away.  
The hand with the whip pointed to the south.  
The boy had met the alchemist.  
 
 
 
NEXT MORNING, THERE WERE TWO THOUSAND AR MED men scattered 
throughout the palm trees at Al -Fayoum. Before the sun had 
reached its high point, five hundred tribesmen appeared on the 
horizon. The mounted troops entered the oasis from the north; it 
appeared to be a peaceful expedition, but they all carried arms 
hidden in their robes. When they reached the white tent at the 
center of Al -Fayoum, they withdrew their scimitars and rifles. And 
they attacked an empty tent.  
The men of the oasis surrounded the horsemen from the desert 
and within half an hour  all but one of the intruders were dead. The 
children had been kept at the other side of a grove of palm trees, 
and saw nothing of what had happened. The women had remained 
in their tents, praying for the safekeeping of their husbands, and 
saw nothing of t he battle, either. Were it not for the bodies there on 
the ground, it would have appeared to be a normal day at the oasis.  
The only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion. 
That afternoon, he was brought before the tribal chieftains, who 
asked him why he had violated the Tradition. The commander said 
that his men had been starving and thirsty, exhausted from many days of battle, and had decided to take the oasis so as to be able to 
return to the war.  
The tribal chieftain said that he felt sorry for the tribesmen, but 
that the Tradition was sacred. He condemned the commander to 
death without honor. Rather than being killed by a blade or a bullet, 
he was hanged from a dead palm tree, where his body twisted in the 
desert wind.  
The tribal chieftain c alled for the boy, and presented him with 
fifty pieces of gold. He repeated his story about Joseph of Egypt, and 
asked the boy to become the counselor of the oasis.  
 
 
 
WHEN THE SUN HAD SET, AND THE FIRST STARS MADE  their appearance, the 
boy started to walk  to the south. He eventually sighted a single tent, 
and a group of Arabs passing by told the boy that it was a place 
inhabited by genies. But the boy sat down and waited.  
Not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view. He 
carried two dead haw ks over his shoulder.  
“I am here,” the boy said.  
“You shouldn’t be here,” the alchemist answered. “Or is it your 
Personal Legend that brings you here?”  
“With the wars between the tribes, it’s impossible to cross the 
desert. So I have come here.”  
The alchem ist dismounted from his horse, and signaled that the 
boy should enter the tent with him. It was a tent like many at the 
oasis. The boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus 
used in alchemy, but saw none. There were only some books in a 
pile, a sm all cooking stove, and the carpets, covered with 
mysterious designs.  “Sit down. We’ll have something to drink and eat these hawks,” 
said the alchemist.  
The boy suspected that they were the same hawks he had seen 
on the day before, but he said nothing. The alchemist lighted the 
fire, and soon a delicious aroma filled the tent. It was better than the 
scent of the hookahs.  
“Why did you want to see me?” the boy asked.  
“Because of the omens,” the alchemist answered. “The wind told 
me you would be coming, and tha t you would need help.”  
“It’s not I the wind spoke about. It’s the other foreigner, the 
Englishman. He’s the one that’s looking for you.”  
“He has other things to do first. But he’s on the right track. He 
has begun to try to understand the desert.”  
“And wha t about me?”  
“When a person really desires something, all the universe 
conspires to help that person to realize his dream,” said the 
alchemist, echoing the words of the old king. The boy understood. 
Another person was there to help him toward his Personal Legend.  
“So you are going to instruct me?”  
“No. You already know all you need to know. I am only going to 
point you in the direction of your treasure.”  
“But there’s a tribal war,” the boy reiterated.  
“I know what’s happening in the desert.”  
“I have already  found my treasure. I have a camel, I have my 
money from the crystal shop, and I have fifty gold pieces. In my own 
country, I would be a rich man.”  
“But none of that is from the Pyramids,” said the alchemist.  
“I also have Fatima. She is a treasure greater than anything else I 
have won.”  
“She wasn’t found at the Pyramids, either.”  They ate in silence. The alchemist opened a bottle and poured a 
red liquid into the boy’s cup. It was the most delicious wine he had 
ever tasted.  
“Isn’t wine prohibited here?” the boy asked  
“It’s not what enters men’s mouths that’s evil,” said the 
alchemist. “It’s what comes out of their mouths that is.”  
The alchemist was a bit daunting, but, as the boy drank the wine, 
he relaxed. After they finished eating they sat outside the tent , 
under a moon so brilliant that it made the stars pale.  
“Drink and enjoy yourself,” said the alchemist, noticing that the 
boy was feeling happier. “Rest well tonight, as if you were a warrior 
preparing for combat. Remember that wherever your heart is, the re 
you will find your treasure. You’ve got to find the treasure, so that 
everything you have learned along the way can make sense.  
“Tomorrow, sell your camel and buy a horse. Camels are 
traitorous: they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire. 
Then suddenly, they kneel and die. But horses tire bit by bit. You 
always know how much you can ask of them, and when it is that 
they are about to die.”  
 
 
 
THE FOLLOWING NIGHT, THE BOY APPEARED AT THE  alchemist’s tent with a 
horse. The alchemist was ready, and he mounted his own steed and 
placed the falcon on his left shoulder. He said to the boy, “Show me 
where there is life out in the desert. Only those who can see such 
signs of life are able to find  treasure.”  
They began to ride out over the sands, with the moon lighting 
their way. I don’t know if I’ll be able to find life in the desert, the boy 
thought. I don’t know the desert that well yet.  He wanted to say so to the alchemist, but he was afraid of  the 
man. They reached the rocky place where the boy had seen the 
hawks in the sky, but now there was only silence and the wind.  
“I don’t know how to find life in the desert,” the boy said. “I 
know that there is life here, but I don’t know where to look.”  
“Life attracts life,” the alchemist answered.  
And then the boy understood. He loosened the reins on his 
horse, who galloped forward over the rocks and sand. The alchemist 
followed as the boy’s horse ran for almost half an hour. They could 
no longer see the  palms of the oasis —only the gigantic moon above 
them, and its silver reflections from the stones of the desert. 
Suddenly, for no apparent reason, the boy’s horse began to slow.  
“There’s life here,” the boy said to the alchemist. “I don’t know 
the language  of the desert, but my horse knows the language of life.”  
They dismounted, and the alchemist said nothing. Advancing 
slowly, they searched among the stones. The alchemist stopped 
abruptly, and bent to the ground. There was a hole there among the 
stones. Th e alchemist put his hand into the hole, and then his entire 
arm, up to his shoulder. Something was moving there, and the 
alchemist’s eyes —the boy could see only his eyes —squinted with 
his effort. His arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the 
hole.  Then, with a motion that startled the boy, he withdrew his arm 
and leaped to his feet. In his hand, he grasped a snake by the tail.  
The boy leapt as well, but away from the alchemist. The snake 
fought frantically, making hissing sounds that shattered the silence 
of the desert. It was a cobra, whose venom could kill a person in 
minutes.  
“Watch out for his venom,” the boy said. But even though the 
alchemist had put his hand in the hole, and had surely already been 
bitten, his expression was calm. “The alchem ist is two hundred years old,” the Englishman had told him. He must know how to deal 
with the snakes of the desert.  
The boy watched as his companion went to his horse and 
withdrew a scimitar. With its blade, he drew a circle in the sand, and 
then he placed  the snake within it. The serpent relaxed immediately.  
“Not to worry,” said the alchemist. “He won’t leave the circle. 
You found life in the desert, the omen that I needed.”  
“Why was that so important?”  
“Because the Pyramids are surrounded by the desert.”  
The boy didn’t want to talk about the Pyramids. His heart was 
heavy, and he had been melancholy since the previous night. To 
continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon 
Fatima.  
“I’m going to guide you across the desert,” the alchemist  said.  
“I want to stay at the oasis,” the boy answered. “I’ve found 
Fatima, and, as far as I’m concerned, she’s worth more than 
treasure.”  
“Fatima is a woman of the desert,” said the alchemist. “She 
knows that men have to go away in order to return. And sh e already 
has her treasure: it’s you. Now she expects that you will find what it 
is you’re looking for.”  
“Well, what if I decide to stay?”  
“Let me tell you what will happen. You’ll be the counselor of the 
oasis. You have enough gold to buy many sheep and m any camels. 
You’ll marry Fatima, and you’ll both be happy for a year. You’ll learn 
to love the desert, and you’ll get to know every one of the fifty 
thousand palms. You’ll watch them as they grow, demonstrating 
how the world is always changing. And you’ll get better and better 
at understanding omens, because the desert is the best teacher 
there is.  “Sometime during the second year, you’ll remember about the 
treasure. The omens will begin insistently to speak of it, and you’ll 
try to ignore them. You’ll use your knowledge for the welfare of the 
oasis and its inhabitants. The tribal chieftains will appreciate what 
you do. And your camels will bring you wealth and power.  
“During the third year, the omens will continue to speak of your 
treasure and your Personal  Legend. You’ll walk around, night after 
night, at the oasis, and Fatima will be unhappy because she’ll feel it 
was she who interrupted your quest. But you will love her, and 
she’ll return your love. You’ll remember that she never asked you to 
stay, becaus e a woman of the desert knows that she must await her 
man. So you won’t blame her. But many times you’ll walk the sands 
of the desert, thinking that maybe you could have left…that you 
could have trusted more in your love for Fatima. Because what kept 
you a t the oasis was your own fear that you might never come back. 
At that point, the omens will tell you that your treasure is buried 
forever.  
“Then, sometime during the fourth year, the omens will abandon 
you, because you’ve stopped listening to them. The tri bal chieftains 
will see that, and you’ll be dismissed from your position as 
counselor. But, by then, you’ll be a rich merchant, with many camels 
and a great deal of merchandise. You’ll spend the rest of your days 
knowing that you didn’t pursue your Persona l Legend, and that now 
it’s too late.  
“You must understand that love never keeps a man from 
pursuing his Personal Legend. If he abandons that pursuit, it’s 
because it wasn’t true love…the love that speaks the Language of 
the World.”  
The alchemist erased th e circle in the sand, and the snake 
slithered away among the rocks. The boy remembered the crystal merchant who had always wanted to go to Mecca, and the 
Englishman in search of the alchemist. He thought of the woman 
who had trusted in the desert. And he l ooked out over the desert 
that had brought him to the woman he loved.  
They mounted their horses, and this time it was the boy who 
followed the alchemist back to the oasis. The wind brought the 
sounds of the oasis to them, and the boy tried to hear Fatima’s  voice.  
But that night, as he had watched the cobra within the circle, the 
strange horseman with the falcon on his shoulder had spoken of 
love and treasure, of the women of the desert and of his Personal 
Legend.  
“I’m going with you,” the boy said. And he i mmediately felt peace 
in his heart.  
“We’ll leave tomorrow before sunrise,” was the alchemist’s only 
response.  
 
 
 
THE BOY SPENT A SLEEPLESS NIGHT . TWO HOURS BEFORE  dawn, he awoke 
one of the boys who slept in his tent, and asked him to show him 
where Fatima lived. They went to her tent, and the boy gave his 
friend enough gold to buy a sheep.  
Then he asked his friend to go into the tent where Fatima was 
sleeping, and to awaken her and tell her that he was waiting outside. 
The young Arab did as he was asked, an d was given enough gold to 
buy yet another sheep.  
“Now leave us alone,” said the boy to the young Arab. The Arab 
returned to his tent to sleep, proud to have helped the counselor of 
the oasis, and happy at having enough money to buy himself some 
sheep.  Fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent. The two walked out 
among the palms. The boy knew that it was a violation of the 
Tradition, but that didn’t matter to him now.  
“I’m going away,” he said. “And I want you to know that I’m 
coming back. I love you beca use…”  
“Don’t say anything,” Fatima interrupted. “One is loved because 
one is loved. No reason is needed for loving.”  
But the boy continued, “I had a dream, and I met with a king. I 
sold crystal and crossed the desert. And, because the tribes declared 
war, I went to the well, seeking the alchemist. So, I love you because 
the entire universe conspired to help me find you.”  
The two embraced. It was the first time either had touched the 
other.  
“I’ll be back,” the boy said.  
“Before this, I always looked to the d esert with longing,” said 
Fatima. “Now it will be with hope. My father went away one day, but 
he returned to my mother, and he has always come back since 
then.”  
They said nothing else. They walked a bit farther among the 
palms, and then the boy left her at  the entrance to her tent.  
“I’ll return, just as your father came back to your mother,” he 
said.  
He saw that Fatima’s eyes were filled with tears.  
“You’re crying?”  
“I’m a woman of the desert,” she said, averting her face. “But 
above all, I’m a woman.”  
Fatima went back to her tent, and, when daylight came, she went 
out to do the chores she had done for years. But everything had 
changed. The boy was no longer at the oasis, and the oasis would 
never again have the same meaning it had had only yesterday. It wou ld no longer be a place with fifty thousand palm trees and three 
hundred wells, where the pilgrims arrived, relieved at the end of 
their long journeys. From that day on, the oasis would be an empty 
place for her.  
From that day on, it was the desert that wo uld be important. She 
would look to it every day, and would try to guess which star the 
boy was following in search of his treasure. She would have to send 
her kisses on the wind, hoping that the wind would touch the boy’s 
face, and would tell him that she  was alive. That she was waiting for 
him, a woman awaiting a courageous man in search of his treasure. 
From that day on, the desert would represent only one thing to her: 
the hope for his return.  
 
 
 
“DON’T THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU’VE LEFT BEHIND, ” THE alchemist said to 
the boy as they began to ride across the sands of the desert. 
“Everything is written in the Soul of the World, and there it will stay 
forever.”  
“Men dream more about coming home than about leaving,” the 
boy said. He was already reaccusto med to the desert’s silence.  
“If what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil. And 
one can always come back. If what you had found was only a 
moment of light, like the explosion of a star, you would find nothing 
on your return.”  
The man was s peaking the language of alchemy. But the boy 
knew that he was referring to Fatima.  
It was difficult not to think about what he had left behind. The 
desert, with its endless monotony, put him to dreaming. The boy 
could still see the palm trees, the wells, a nd the face of the woman he loved. He could see the Englishman at his experiments, and the 
camel driver who was a teacher without realizing it. Maybe the 
alchemist has never been in love, the boy thought.  
The alchemist rode in front, with the falcon on his  shoulder. The 
bird knew the language of the desert well, and whenever they 
stopped, he flew off in search of game. On the first day he returned 
with a rabbit, and on the second with two birds.  
At night, they spread their sleeping gear and kept their fires  
hidden. The desert nights were cold, and were becoming darker and 
darker as the phases of the moon passed. They went on for a week, 
speaking only of the precautions they needed to follow in order to 
avoid the battles between the tribes. The war continued,  and at 
times the wind carried the sweet, sickly smell of blood. Battles had 
been fought nearby, and the wind reminded the boy that there was 
the language of omens, always ready to show him what his eyes had 
failed to observe.  
On the seventh day, the alche mist decided to make camp earlier 
than usual. The falcon flew off to find game, and the alchemist 
offered his water container to the boy.  
“You are almost at the end of your journey,” said the alchemist. 
“I congratulate you for having pursued your Personal Legend.”  
“And you’ve told me nothing along the way,” said the boy. “I 
thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know. A 
while ago, I rode through the desert with a man who had books on 
alchemy. But I wasn’t able to learn anything from them. ” 
“There is only one way to learn,” the alchemist answered. “It’s 
through action. Everything you need to know you have learned 
through your journey. You need to learn only one thing more.”  
The boy wanted to know what that was, but the alchemist was 
searchi ng the horizon, looking for the falcon.  “Why are you called the alchemist?”  
“Because that’s what I am.”  
“And what went wrong when other alchemists tried to make 
gold and were unable to do so?”  
“They were looking only for gold,” his companion answered. 
“The y were seeking the treasure of their Personal Legend, without 
wanting actually to live out the Personal Legend.”  
“What is it that I still need to know?” the boy asked.  
But the alchemist continued to look to the horizon. And finally 
the falcon returned with  their meal. They dug a hole and lit their fire 
in it, so that the light of the flames would not be seen.  
“I’m an alchemist simply because I’m an alchemist,” he said, as 
he prepared the meal. “I learned the science from my grandfather, 
who learned from his  father, and so on, back to the creation of the 
world. In those times, the Master Work could be written simply on 
an emerald. But men began to reject simple things, and to write 
tracts, interpretations, and philosophical studies. They also began to 
feel th at they knew a better way than others had. Yet the Emerald 
Tablet is still alive today.”  
“What was written on the Emerald Tablet?” the boy wanted to 
know.  
The alchemist began to draw in the sand, and completed his 
drawing in less than five minutes. As he d rew, the boy thought of 
the old king, and the plaza where they had met that day; it seemed 
as if it had taken place years and years ago.  
“This is what was written on the Emerald Tablet,” said the 
alchemist, when he had finished.  
The boy tried to read what was written in the sand.  
“It’s a code,” said the boy, a bit disappointed. “It looks like what I 
saw in the Englishman’s books.”  “No,” the alchemist answered. “It’s like the flight of those two 
hawks; it can’t be understood by reason alone. The Emerald Tabl et 
is a direct passage to the Soul of the World.  
“The wise men understood that this natural world is only an 
image and a copy of paradise. The existence of this world is simply a 
guarantee that there exists a world that is perfect. God created the 
world so  that, through its visible objects, men could understand his 
spiritual teachings and the marvels of his wisdom. That’s what I 
mean by action.”  
“Should I understand the Emerald Tablet?” the boy asked.  
“Perhaps, if you were in a laboratory of alchemy, this would be 
the right time to study the best way to understand the Emerald 
Tablet. But you are in the desert. So immerse yourself in it. The 
desert will give you an understanding of the world; in fact, anything 
on the face of the earth will do that. You don’t  even have to 
understand the desert: all you have to do is contemplate a simple 
grain of sand, and you will see in it all the marvels of creation.”  
“How do I immerse myself in the desert?”  
“Listen to your heart. It knows all things, because it came from 
the Soul of the World, and it will one day return there.”  
 
 
 
THEY CROSSED THE DESERT FOR ANOTHER TWO DAYS IN  silence. The 
alchemist had become much more cautious, because they were 
approaching the area where the most violent battles were being 
waged. As they  moved along, the boy tried to listen to his heart.  
It was not easy to do; in earlier times, his heart had always been 
ready to tell its story, but lately that wasn’t true. There had been 
times when his heart spent hours telling of its sadness, and at othe r times it became so emotional over the desert sunrise that the boy 
had to hide his tears. His heart beat fastest when it spoke to the boy 
of treasure, and more slowly when the boy stared entranced at the 
endless horizons of the desert. But his heart was n ever quiet, even 
when the boy and the alchemist had fallen into silence.  
“Why do we have to listen to our hearts?” the boy asked, when 
they had made camp that day.  
“Because, wherever your heart is, that is where you’ll find your 
treasure.”  
“But my heart is  agitated,” the boy said. “It has its dreams, it gets 
emotional, and it’s become passionate over a woman of the desert. 
It asks things of me, and it keeps me from sleeping many nights, 
when I’m thinking about her.”  
“Well, that’s good. Your heart is alive. Keep listening to what it 
has to say.”  
During the next three days, the two travelers passed by a 
number of armed tribesmen, and saw others on the horizon. The 
boy’s heart began to speak of fear. It told him stories it had heard 
from the Soul of the World, stories of men who sought to find their 
treasure and never succeeded. Sometimes it frightened the boy with 
the idea that he might not find his treasure, or that he might die 
there in the desert. At other times, it told the boy that it was 
satisfied: it had  found love and riches.  
“My heart is a traitor,” the boy said to the alchemist, when they 
had paused to rest the horses. “It doesn’t want me to go on.”  
“That makes sense,” the alchemist answered. “Naturally it’s 
afraid that, in pursuing your dream, you mig ht lose everything 
you’ve won.”  
“Well, then, why should I listen to my heart?”  “Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet. Even if 
you pretend not to have heard what it tells you, it will always be 
there inside you, repeating to you what you’re  thinking about life 
and about the world.”  
“You mean I should listen, even if it’s treasonous?”  
“Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly. If you know your 
heart well, it will never be able to do that to you. Because you’ll 
know its dreams and wishes, and  will know how to deal with them.  
“You will never be able to escape from your heart. So it’s better 
to listen to what it has to say. That way, you’ll never have to fear an 
unanticipated blow.”  
The boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the 
desert. He came to understand its dodges and tricks, and to accept it 
as it was. He lost his fear, and forgot about his need to go back to the 
oasis, because, one afternoon, his heart told him that it was happy. 
“Even though I complain sometimes,” it said, “ it’s because I’m the 
heart of a person, and people’s hearts are that way. People are 
afraid to pursue their most important dreams, because they feel 
that they don’t deserve them, or that they’ll be unable to achieve 
them. We, their hearts, become fearful j ust thinking of loved ones 
who go away forever, or of moments that could have been good but 
weren’t, or of treasures that might have been found but were 
forever hidden in the sands. Because, when these things happen, we 
suffer terribly.”  
“My heart is afrai d that it will have to suffer,” the boy told the 
alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky.  
“Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the 
suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in 
search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a 
second’s encounter with God and with eternity.”  “Every second of the search is an encounter with God,” the boy 
told his heart. “When I have been truly searching for my treasure, 
every day has been luminous, b ecause I’ve known that every hour 
was a part of the dream that I would find it. When I have been truly 
searching for my treasure, I’ve discovered things along the way that 
I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that 
seemed impossib le for a shepherd to achieve.”  
So his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon. That night, the 
boy slept deeply, and, when he awoke, his heart began to tell him 
things that came from the Soul of the World. It said that all people 
who are happy have God wit hin them. And that happiness could be 
found in a grain of sand from the desert, as the alchemist had said. 
Because a grain of sand is a moment of creation, and the universe 
has taken millions of years to create it. “Everyone on earth has a 
treasure that aw aits him,” his heart said. “We, people’s hearts, 
seldom say much about those treasures, because people no longer 
want to go in search of them. We speak of them only to children. 
Later, we simply let life proceed, in its own direction, toward its 
own fate. But, unfortunately, very few follow the path laid out for 
them —the path to their Personal Legends, and to happiness. Most 
people see the world as a threatening place, and, because they do, 
the world turns out, indeed, to be a threatening place.  
“So, we, th eir hearts, speak more and more softly. We never stop 
speaking out, but we begin to hope that our words won’t be heard: 
we don’t want people to suffer because they don’t follow their 
hearts.”  
“Why don’t people’s hearts tell them to continue to follow their  
dreams?” the boy asked the alchemist.  
“Because that’s what makes a heart suffer most, and hearts don’t 
like to suffer.”  From then on, the boy understood his heart. He asked it, please, 
never to stop speaking to him. He asked that, when he wandered far 
from his dreams, his heart press him and sound the alarm. The boy 
swore that, every time he heard the alarm, he would heed its 
message.  
That night, he told all of this to the alchemist. And the alchemist 
understood that the boy’s heart had returned to the Soul of the 
World.  
“So what should I do now?” the boy asked.  
“Continue in the direction of the Pyramids,” said the alchemist. 
“And continue to pay heed to the omens. Your heart is still capable 
of showing you where the treasure is.”  
“Is that the one thing I still needed to know?”  
“No,” the alchemist answered. “What you still need to know is 
this: before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests 
everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because 
it is evil, but so that we can, in addi tion to realizing our dreams, 
master the lessons we’ve learned as we’ve moved toward that 
dream. That’s the point at which most people give up. It’s the point 
at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one ‘dies of thirst 
just when the palm trees h ave appeared on the horizon.’  
“Every search begins with beginner’s luck. And every search 
ends with the victor’s being severely tested.”  
The boy remembered an old proverb from his country. It said 
that the darkest hour of the night came just before the daw n. 
 
 
 ON THE FOLLOWING DAY, THE FIRST CLEAR SIGN OF  danger appeared. 
Three armed tribesmen approached, and asked what the boy and 
the alchemist were doing there.  
“I’m hunting with my falcon,” the alchemist answered.  
“We’re going to have to search you to se e whether you’re 
armed,” one of the tribesmen said.  
The alchemist dismounted slowly, and the boy did the same.  
“Why are you carrying money?” asked the tribesman, when he 
had searched the boy’s bag.  
“I need it to get to the Pyramids,” he said.  
The tribesman  who was searching the alchemist’s belongings 
found a small crystal flask filled with a liquid, and a yellow glass egg 
that was slightly larger than a chicken’s egg.  
“What are these things?” he asked.  
“That’s the Philosopher’s Stone and the Elixir of Life.  It’s the 
Master Work of the alchemists. Whoever swallows that elixir will 
never be sick again, and a fragment from that stone turns any metal 
into gold.”  
The Arabs laughed at him, and the alchemist laughed along. They 
thought his answer was amusing, and t hey allowed the boy and the 
alchemist to proceed with all of their belongings.  
“Are you crazy?” the boy asked the alchemist, when they had 
moved on. “What did you do that for?”  
“To show you one of life’s simple lessons,” the alchemist 
answered. “When you p ossess great treasures within you, and try to 
tell others of them, seldom are you believed.”  
They continued across the desert. With every day that passed, 
the boy’s heart became more and more silent. It no longer wanted to 
know about things of the past or future; it was content simply to 
contemplate the desert, and to drink with the boy from the Soul of the World. The boy and his heart had become friends, and neither 
was capable now of betraying the other.  
When his heart spoke to him, it was to provide a st imulus to the 
boy, and to give him strength, because the days of silence there in 
the desert were wearisome. His heart told the boy what his 
strongest qualities were: his courage in having given up his sheep 
and in trying to live out his Personal Legend, a nd his enthusiasm 
during the time he had worked at the crystal shop.  
And his heart told him something else that the boy had never 
noticed: it told the boy of dangers that had threatened him, but that 
he had never perceived. His heart said that one time it had hidden 
the rifle the boy had taken from his father, because of the possibility 
that the boy might wound himself. And it reminded the boy of the 
day when he had been ill and vomiting out in the fields, after which 
he had fallen into a deep sleep. There had been two thieves farther 
ahead who were planning to steal the boy’s sheep and murder him. 
But, since the boy hadn’t passed by, they had decided to move on, 
thinking that he had changed his route.  
“Does a man’s heart always help him?” the boy asked the 
alchemist.  
“Mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their 
Personal Legends. But they do help children, drunkards, and the 
elderly, too.”  
“Does that mean that I’ll never run into danger?”  
“It means only that the heart does what it can,” th e alchemist 
said.  
One afternoon, they passed by the encampment of one of the 
tribes. At each corner of the camp were Arabs garbed in beautiful 
white robes, with arms at the ready. The men were smoking their hookahs and trading stories from the battlefield.  No one paid any 
attention to the two travelers.  
“There’s no danger,” the boy said, when they had moved on past 
the encampment.  
The alchemist sounded angry: “Trust in your heart, but never 
forget that you’re in the desert. When men are at war with one 
anot her, the Soul of the World can hear the screams of battle. No 
one fails to suffer the consequences of everything under the sun.”  
All things are one, the boy thought. And then, as if the desert 
wanted to demonstrate that the alchemist was right, two horseme n 
appeared from behind the travelers.  
“You can’t go any farther,” one of them said. “You’re in the area 
where the tribes are at war.”  
“I’m not going very far,” the alchemist answered, looking 
straight into the eyes of the horsemen. They were silent for a 
moment, and then agreed that the boy and the alchemist could 
move along.  
The boy watched the exchange with fascination. “You dominated 
those horsemen with the way you looked at them,” he said.  
“Your eyes show the strength of your soul,” answered the 
alchemi st. 
That’s true, the boy thought. He had noticed that, in the midst of 
the multitude of armed men back at the encampment, there had 
been one who stared fixedly at the two. He had been so far away 
that his face wasn’t even visible. But the boy was certain t hat he had 
been looking at them.  
Finally, when they had crossed the mountain range that 
extended along the entire horizon, the alchemist said that they were 
only two days from the Pyramids.  “If we’re going to go our separate ways soon,” the boy said, “then  
teach me about alchemy.”  
“You already know about alchemy. It is about penetrating to the 
Soul of the World, and discovering the treasure that has been 
reserved for you.”  
“No, that’s not what I mean. I’m talking about transforming lead 
into gold.”  
The alch emist fell as silent as the desert, and answered the boy 
only after they had stopped to eat.  
“Everything in the universe evolved,” he said. “And, for wise 
men, gold is the metal that evolved the furthest. Don’t ask me why; I 
don’t know why. I just know tha t the Tradition is always right.  
“Men have never understood the words of the wise. So gold, 
instead of being seen as a symbol of evolution, became the basis for 
conflict.”  
“There are many languages spoken by things,” the boy said. 
“There was a time when, for me, a camel’s whinnying was nothing 
more than whinnying. Then it became a signal of danger. And, 
finally, it became just a whinny again.”  
But then he stopped. The alchemist probably already knew all 
that.  
“I have known true alchemists,” the alchemist c ontinued. “They 
locked themselves in their laboratories, and tried to evolve, as gold 
had. And they found the Philosopher’s Stone, because they 
understood that when something evolves, everything around that 
thing evolves as well.  
“Others stumbled upon the stone by accident. They already had 
the gift, and their souls were readier for such things than the souls 
of others. But they don’t count. They’re quite rare.  “And then there were the others, who were interested only in 
gold. They never found the secret. T hey forgot that lead, copper, and 
iron have their own Personal Legends to fulfill. And anyone who 
interferes with the Personal Legend of another thing never will 
discover his own.”  
The alchemist’s words echoed out like a curse. He reached over 
and picked u p a shell from the ground.  
“This desert was once a sea,” he said.  
“I noticed that,” the boy answered.  
The alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear. He had 
done that many times when he was a child, and had heard the sound 
of the sea.  
“The sea has lived on in this shell, because that’s its Personal 
Legend. And it will never cease doing so until the desert is once 
again covered by water.”  
They mounted their horses, and rode out in the direction of the 
Pyramids of Egypt.  
 
 
 
THE SUN WAS SETTING WHEN THE BOY’S HEART SOUNDED  a danger signal. 
They were surrounded by gigantic dunes, and the boy looked at the 
alchemist to see whether he had sensed anything. But he appeared 
to be unaware of any danger. Five minutes later, the boy saw two 
horsemen waiti ng ahead of them. Before he could say anything to 
the alchemist, the two horsemen had become ten, and then a 
hundred. And then they were everywhere in the dunes.  
They were tribesmen dressed in blue, with black rings 
surrounding their turbans. Their faces w ere hidden behind blue 
veils, with only their eyes showing.  Even from a distance, their eyes conveyed the strength of their 
souls. And their eyes spoke of death.  
 
 
 
THE TWO WERE TAKEN TO A NEARBY MILITARY CAMP . A soldier shoved the 
boy and the alchemist in to a tent where the chief was holding a 
meeting with his staff.  
“These are the spies,” said one of the men.  
“We’re just travelers,” the alchemist answered.  
“You were seen at the enemy camp three days ago. And you 
were talking with one of the troops there.”  
“I’m just a man who wanders the desert and knows the stars,” 
said the alchemist. “I have no information about troops or about the 
movement of the tribes. I was simply acting as a guide for my friend 
here.”  
“Who is your friend?” the chief asked.  
“An alchem ist,” said the alchemist. “He understands the forces of 
nature. And he wants to show you his extraordinary powers.”  
The boy listened quietly. And fearfully.  
“What is a foreigner doing here?” asked another of the men.  
“He has brought money to give to your t ribe,” said the alchemist, 
before the boy could say a word. And seizing the boy’s bag, the 
alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief.  
The Arab accepted them without a word. There was enough 
there to buy a lot of weapons.  
“What is an alchemist?” he asked, finally.  
“It’s a man who understands nature and the world. If he wanted 
to, he could destroy this camp just with the force of the wind.”  The men laughed. They were used to the ravages of war, and 
knew that the wind could not deliver them a fatal blow. Yet each felt 
his heart beat a bit faster. They were men of the desert, and they 
were fearful of sorcerers.  
“I want to see him do it,” said the chief.  
“He needs three days,” answered the alchemist. “He is going to 
transform himself into the wind, just to demon strate his powers. If 
he can’t do so, we humbly offer you our lives, for the honor of your 
tribe.”  
“You can’t offer me something that is already mine,” the chief 
said, arrogantly. But he granted the travelers three days.  
The boy was shaking with fear, but the alchemist helped him out 
of the tent.  
“Don’t let them see that you’re afraid,” the alchemist said. “They 
are brave men, and they despise cowards.”  
But the boy couldn’t even speak. He was able to do so only after 
they had walked through the center of th e camp. There was no need 
to imprison them: the Arabs simply confiscated their horses. So, 
once again, the world had demonstrated its many languages: the 
desert only moments ago had been endless and free, and now it was 
an impenetrable wall.  
“You gave them  everything I had!” the boy said. “Everything I’ve 
saved in my entire life!”  
“Well, what good would it be to you if you had to die?” the 
alchemist answered. “Your money saved us for three days. It’s not 
often that money saves a person’s life.”  
But the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom. He 
had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind. 
He wasn’t an alchemist!  The alchemist asked one of the soldiers for some tea, and poured 
some on the boy’s wrists. A wave of relief washed over him, and the 
alchemist muttered some words that the boy didn’t understand.  
“Don’t give in to your fears,” said the alchemist, in a strangely 
gentle voice. “If you do, you won’t be able to talk to your heart.”  
“But I have no idea how to turn myself int o the wind.”  
“If a person is living out his Personal Legend, he knows 
everything he needs to know. There is only one thing that makes a 
dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.”  
“I’m not afraid of failing. It’s just that I don’t know how to turn 
myself into the wind.”  
“Well, you’ll have to learn; your life depends on it.”  
“But what if I can’t?”  
“Then you’ll die in the midst of trying to realize your Personal 
Legend. That’s a lot better than dying like millions of other people, 
who never even knew w hat their Personal Legends were.  
“But don’t worry,” the alchemist continued. “Usually the threat 
of death makes people a lot more aware of their lives.”  
 
 
 
THE FIRST DAY PASSED . T HERE WAS A MAJOR BATTLE  nearby, and a 
number of wounded were brought back to the camp. The dead 
soldiers were replaced by others, and life went on. Death doesn’t 
change anything, the boy thought.  
“You could have died later on,” a soldier said to the body of one 
of his companions . “You could have died after peace had been 
declared. But, in any case, you were going to die.”  
At the end of the day, the boy went looking for the alchemist, 
who had taken his falcon out into the desert.  “I still have no idea how to turn myself into the w ind,” the boy 
repeated.  
“Remember what I told you: the world is only the visible aspect 
of God. And that what alchemy does is to bring spiritual perfection 
into contact with the material plane.”  
“What are you doing?”  
“Feeding my falcon.”  
“If I’m not able t o turn myself into the wind, we’re going to die,” 
the boy said. “Why feed your falcon?”  
“You’re the one who may die,” the alchemist said. “I already 
know how to turn myself into the wind.”  
 
 
 
ON THE SECOND DAY, THE BOY CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF A  cliff near th e 
camp. The sentinels allowed him to go; they had already heard 
about the sorcerer who could turn himself into the wind, and they 
didn’t want to go near him. In any case, the desert was impassable.  
He spent the entire afternoon of the second day looking ou t over 
the desert, and listening to his heart. The boy knew the desert 
sensed his fear.  
They both spoke the same language.  
 
 
 
ON THE THIRD DAY, THE CHIEF MET WITH HIS OFFICERS.  He called the 
alchemist to the meeting and said, “Let’s go see the boy who turns 
himself into the wind.”  
“Let’s,” the alchemist answered.  The boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the 
previous day. He told them all to be seated.  
“It’s going to t ake awhile,” the boy said.  
“We’re in no hurry,” the chief answered. “We are men of the 
desert.”  
The boy looked out at the horizon. There were mountains in the 
distance. And there were dunes, rocks, and plants that insisted on 
living where survival seemed i mpossible. There was the desert that 
he had wandered for so many months; despite all that time, he knew 
only a small part of it. Within that small part, he had found an 
Englishman, caravans, tribal wars, and an oasis with fifty thousand 
palm trees and thre e hundred wells.  
“What do you want here today?” the desert asked him. “Didn’t 
you spend enough time looking at me yesterday?”  
“Somewhere you are holding the person I love,” the boy said. 
“So, when I look out over your sands, I am also looking at her. I wan t 
to return to her, and I need your help so that I can turn myself into 
the wind.”  
“What is love?” the desert asked.  
“Love is the falcon’s flight over your sands. Because for him, you 
are a green field, from which he always returns with game. He 
knows your  rocks, your dunes, and your mountains, and you are 
generous to him.”  
“The falcon’s beak carries bits of me, myself,” the desert said. 
“For years, I care for his game, feeding it with the little water that I 
have, and then I show him where the game is. And , one day, as I 
enjoy the fact that his game thrives on my surface, the falcon dives 
out of the sky, and takes away what I’ve created.”  
“But that’s why you created the game in the first place,” the boy 
answered. “To nourish the falcon. And the falcon then nourishes man. And, eventually, man will nourish your sands, where the game 
will once again flourish. That’s how the world goes.”  
“So is that what love is?”  
“Yes, that’s what love is. It’s what makes the game become the 
falcon, the falcon become man, and m an, in his turn, the desert. It’s 
what turns lead into gold, and makes the gold return to the earth.”  
“I don’t understand what you’re talking about,” the desert said.  
“But you can at least understand that somewhere in your sands 
there is a woman waiting fo r me. And that’s why I have to turn 
myself into the wind.”  
The desert didn’t answer him for a few moments.  
Then it told him, “I’ll give you my sands to help the wind to blow, 
but, alone, I can’t do anything. You have to ask for help from the 
wind.”  
A breez e began to blow. The tribesmen watched the boy from a 
distance, talking among themselves in a language that the boy 
couldn’t understand.  
The alchemist smiled.  
The wind approached the boy and touched his face. It knew of 
the boy’s talk with the desert, beca use the winds know everything. 
They blow across the world without a birthplace, and with no place 
to die.  
“Help me,” the boy said. “One day you carried the voice of my 
loved one to me.”  
“Who taught you to speak the language of the desert and the 
wind?”  
“My  heart,” the boy answered.  
The wind has many names. In that part of the world, it was 
called the sirocco, because it brought moisture from the oceans to 
the east. In the distant land the boy came from, they called it the levanter, because they believed tha t it brought with it the sands of 
the desert, and the screams of the Moorish wars. Perhaps, in the 
places beyond the pastures where his sheep lived, men thought that 
the wind came from Andalusia. But, actually, the wind came from no 
place at all, nor did i t go to any place; that’s why it was stronger 
than the desert. Someone might one day plant trees in the desert, 
and even raise sheep there, but never would they harness the wind.  
“You can’t be the wind,” the wind said. “We’re two very different 
things.”  
“That’s not true,” the boy said. “I learned the alchemist’s secrets 
in my travels. I have inside me the winds, the deserts, the oceans, 
the stars, and everything created in the universe. We were all made 
by the same hand, and we have the same soul. I want to  be like you, 
able to reach every corner of the world, cross the seas, blow away 
the sands that cover my treasure, and carry the voice of the woman 
I love.”  
“I heard what you were talking about the other day with the 
alchemist,” the wind said. “He said that everything has its own 
Personal Legend. But people can’t turn themselves into the wind.”  
“Just teach me to be the wind for a few moments,” the boy said. 
“So you and I can talk about the limitless possibilities of people and 
the winds.”  
The wind’s curi osity was aroused, something that had never 
happened before. It wanted to talk about those things, but it didn’t 
know how to turn a man into the wind. And look how many things 
the wind already knew how to do! It created deserts, sank ships, 
felled entire f orests, and blew through cities filled with music and 
strange noises. It felt that it had no limits, yet here was a boy saying 
that there were other things the wind should be able to do.  “This is what we call love,” the boy said, seeing that the wind 
was c lose to granting what he requested. “When you are loved, you 
can do anything in creation. When you are loved, there’s no need at 
all to understand what’s happening, because everything happens 
within you, and even men can turn themselves into the wind. As 
long as the wind helps, of course.”  
The wind was a proud being, and it was becoming irritated with 
what the boy was saying. It commenced to blow harder, raising the 
desert sands. But finally it had to recognize that, even making its 
may around the world, it  didn’t know how to turn a man into the 
wind. And it knew nothing about love.  
“In my travels around the world, I’ve often seen people speaking 
of love and looking toward the heavens,” the wind said, furious at 
having to acknowledge its own limitations. “Ma ybe it’s better to ask 
heaven.”  
“Well then, help me do that,” the boy said. “Fill this place with a 
sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun. Then I can look to 
heaven without blinding myself.”  
So the wind blew with all its strength, and the sky was filled with 
sand. The sun was turned into a golden disk.  
At the camp, it was difficult to see anything. The men of the 
desert were already familiar with that wind. They called it the 
simum,  and it was worse than a storm at sea. Their horses cried out, 
and all their weapons were filled with sand.  
On the heights, one of the commanders turned to the chief and 
said, “Maybe we had better end this!”  
They could barely see the boy. Their faces were covered with the 
blue cloths, and their eyes showed fear.  
“Let’s st op this,” another commander said.  “I want to see the greatness of Allah,” the chief said, with respect. 
“I want to see how a man turns himself into the wind.”  
But he made a mental note of the names of the two men who had 
expressed their fear. As soon as th e wind stopped, he was going to 
remove them from their commands, because true men of the desert 
are not afraid.  
“The wind told me that you know about love,” the boy said to the 
sun. “If you know about love, you must also know about the Soul of 
the World, b ecause it’s made of love.”  
“From where I am,” the sun said, “I can see the Soul of the World. 
It communicates with my soul, and together we cause the plants to 
grow and the sheep to seek out shade. From where I am —and I’m a 
long way from the earth —I learne d how to love. I know that if I 
came even a little bit closer to the earth, everything there would die, 
and the Soul of the World would no longer exist. So we contemplate 
each other, and we want each other, and I give it life and warmth, 
and it gives me my  reason for living.”  
“So you know about love,” the boy said.  
“And I know the Soul of the World, because we have talked at 
great length to each other during this endless trip through the 
universe. It tells me that its greatest problem is that, up until now,  
only the minerals and vegetables understand that all things are one. 
That there’s no need for iron to be the same as copper, or copper 
the same as gold. Each performs its own exact function as a unique 
being, and everything would be a symphony of peace if  the hand 
that wrote all this had stopped on the fifth day of creation.  
“But there was a sixth day,” the sun went on.  
“You are wise, because you observe everything from a distance,” 
the boy said. “But you don’t know about love. If there hadn’t been a 
sixth  day, man would not exist; copper would always be just copper, and lead just lead. It’s true that everything has its Personal Legend, 
but one day that Personal Legend will be realized. So each thing has 
to transform itself into something better, and to acq uire a new 
Personal Legend, until, someday, the Soul of the World becomes one 
thing only.”  
The sun thought about that, and decided to shine more brightly. 
The wind, which was enjoying the conversation, started to blow 
with greater force, so that the sun wo uld not blind the boy.  
“This is why alchemy exists,” the boy said. “So that everyone will 
search for his treasure, find it, and then want to be better than he 
was in his former life. Lead will play its role until the world has no 
further need for lead; and  then lead will have to turn itself into gold.  
“That’s what alchemists do. They show that, when we strive to 
become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, 
too.”  
“Well, why did you say that I don’t know about love?” the sun 
asked the boy.  
“Because it’s not love to be static like the desert, nor is it love to 
roam the world like the wind. And it’s not love to see everything 
from a distance, like you do. Love is the force that transforms and 
improves the Soul of the World. When I first reache d through to it, I 
thought the Soul of the World was perfect. But later, I could see that 
it was like other aspects of creation, and had its own passions and 
wars. It is we who nourish the Soul of the World, and the world we 
live in will be either better o r worse, depending on whether we 
become better or worse. And that’s where the power of love comes 
in. Because when we love, we always strive to become better than 
we are.”  
“So what do you want of me?” the sun asked.  “I want you to help me turn myself into the wind,” the boy 
answered.  
“Nature knows me as the wisest being in creation,” the sun said. 
“But I don’t know how to turn you into the wind.”  
“Then, whom should I ask?”  
The sun thought for a minute. The wind was listening closely, 
and wanted to tell every corner of the world that the sun’s wisdom 
had its limitations. That it was unable to deal with this boy who 
spoke the Language of the World.  
“Speak to the hand that wrote all,” said the sun.  
The wind screamed with delight, and blew harder than ever. The 
tents were being blown from their ties to the earth, and the animals 
were being freed from their tethers. On the cliff, the men clutched at 
each other as they sought to keep from being blown away.  
The boy turned to the hand that wrote all. As he did so , he 
sensed that the universe had fallen silent, and he decided not to 
speak.  
A current of love rushed from his heart, and the boy began to 
pray. It was a prayer that he had never said before, because it was a 
prayer without words or pleas. His prayer didn ’t give thanks for his 
sheep having found new pastures; it didn’t ask that the boy be able 
to sell more crystal; and it didn’t beseech that the woman he had 
met continue to await his return. In the silence, the boy understood 
that the desert, the wind, and  the sun were also trying to 
understand the signs written by the hand, and were seeking to 
follow their paths, and to understand what had been written on a 
single emerald. He saw that omens were scattered throughout the 
earth and in space, and that there w as no reason or significance 
attached to their appearance; he could see that not the deserts, nor 
the winds, nor the sun, nor people knew why they had been created. But that the hand had a reason for all of this, and that only the hand 
could perform miracl es, or transform the sea into a desert…or a 
man into the wind. Because only the hand understood that it was a 
larger design that had moved the universe to the point at which six 
days of creation had evolved into a Master Work.  
The boy reached through to th e Soul of the World, and saw that 
it was a part of the Soul of God. And he saw that the Soul of God was 
his own soul. And that he, a boy, could perform miracles.  
 
 
 
THE  SIMUM  BLEW THAT DAY AS IT HAD NEVER BLOWN  before. For 
generations thereafter, the Arab s recounted the legend of a boy who 
had turned himself into the wind, almost destroying a military 
camp, in defiance of the most powerful chief in the desert.  
When the simum  ceased to blow, everyone looked to the place 
where the boy had been. But he was no  longer there; he was 
standing next to a sand -covered sentinel, on the far side of the 
camp.  
The men were terrified at his sorcery. But there were two 
people who were smiling: the alchemist, because he had found his 
perfect disciple, and the chief, because  that disciple had understood 
the glory of God.  
The following day, the general bade the boy and the alchemist 
farewell, and provided them with an escort party to accompany 
them as far as they chose.  
 
 
 THEY RODE FOR THE ENTIRE DAY . TOWARD THE END OF  the af ternoon, they 
came upon a Coptic monastery. The alchemist dismounted, and told 
the escorts they could return to the camp.  
“From here on, you will be alone,” the alchemist said. “You are 
only three hours from the Pyramids.”  
“Thank you,” said the boy. “You t aught me the Language of the 
World.”  
“I only invoked what you already knew.”  
The alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery. A monk 
dressed in black came to the gates. They spoke for a few minutes in 
the Coptic tongue, and the alchemist bade the boy en ter. 
“I asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while,” the alchemist 
smiled.  
They went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery. The 
alchemist lighted the fire, and the monk brought him some lead, 
which the alchemist placed in an iron pan. When the l ead had 
become liquid, the alchemist took from his pouch the strange yellow 
egg. He scraped from it a sliver as thin as a hair, wrapped it in wax, 
and added it to the pan in which the lead had melted.  
The mixture took on a reddish color, almost the color o f blood. 
The alchemist removed the pan from the fire, and set it aside to cool. 
As he did so, he talked with the monk about the tribal wars.  
“I think they’re going to last for a long time,” he said to the monk.  
The monk was irritated. The caravans had been  stopped at Giza 
for some time, waiting for the wars to end. “But God’s will be done,” 
the monk said.  
“Exactly,” answered the alchemist.  
When the pan had cooled, the monk and the boy looked at it, 
dazzled. The lead had dried into the shape of the pan, but it was no 
longer lead. It was gold.  “Will I learn to do that someday?” the boy asked.  
“This was my Personal Legend, not yours,” the alchemist 
answered. “But I wanted to show you that it was possible.”  
They returned to the gates of the monastery. There, the  
alchemist separated the disk into four parts.  
“This is for you,” he said, holding one of the parts out to the 
monk. “It’s for your generosity to the pilgrims.”  
“But this payment goes well beyond my generosity,” the monk 
responded.  
“Don’t say that again. L ife might be listening, and give you less 
the next time.”  
The alchemist turned to the boy. “This is for you. To make up for 
what you gave to the general.”  
The boy was about to say that it was much more than he had 
given the general. But he kept quiet, beca use he had heard what the 
alchemist said to the monk.  
“And this is for me,” said the alchemist, keeping one of the parts. 
“Because I have to return to the desert, where there are tribal wars.”  
He took the fourth part and handed it to the monk.  
“This is for  the boy. If he ever needs it.”  
“But I’m going in search of my treasure,” the boy said. “I’m very 
close to it now.”  
“And I’m certain you’ll find it,” the alchemist said.  
“Then why this?”  
“Because you have already lost your savings twice. Once to the 
thief,  and once to the general. I’m an old, superstitious Arab, and I 
believe in our proverbs. There’s one that says, ‘Everything that 
happens once can never happen again. But everything that happens 
twice will surely happen a third time.’” They mounted their ho rses.  
  
 
“I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT DREAMS,” SAID THE  alchemist.  
The boy brought his horse closer.  
“In ancient Rome, at the time of Emperor Tiberius, there lived a 
good man who had two sons. One was in the military, and had been 
sent to the most dis tant regions of the empire. The other son was a 
poet, and delighted all of Rome with his beautiful verses.  
“One night, the father had a dream. An angel appeared to him, 
and told him that the words of one of his sons would be learned and 
repeated throughout  the world for all generations to come. The 
father woke from his dream grateful and crying, because life was 
generous, and had revealed to him something any father would be 
proud to know.  
“Shortly thereafter, the father died as he tried to save a child 
who  was about to be crushed by the wheels of a chariot. Since he 
had lived his entire life in a manner that was correct and fair, he 
went directly to heaven, where he met the angel that had appeared 
in his dream.  
“‘You were always a good man,’ the angel said to him. ‘You lived 
your life in a loving way, and died with dignity. I can now grant you 
any wish you desire.’  
“‘Life was good to me,’ the man said. ‘When you appeared in my 
dream, I felt that all my efforts had been rewarded, because my 
son’s poems will b e read by men for generations to come. I don’t 
want anything for myself. But any father would be proud of the 
fame achieved by one whom he had cared for as a child, and 
educated as he grew up. Sometime in the distant future, I would like 
to see my son’s wo rds.’  “The angel touched the man’s shoulder, and they were both 
projected far into the future. They were in an immense setting, 
surrounded by thousands of people speaking a strange language.  
“The man wept with happiness.  
“‘I knew that my son’s poems were i mmortal,’ he said to the 
angel through his tears. ‘Can you please tell me which of my son’s 
poems these people are repeating?’  
“The angel came closer to the man, and, with tenderness, led him 
to a bench nearby, where they sat down.  
“‘The verses of your son  who was the poet were very popular in 
Rome,’ the angel said. ‘Everyone loved them and enjoyed them. But 
when the reign of Tiberius ended, his poems were forgotten. The 
words you’re hearing now are those of your son in the military.’  
“The man looked at the  angel in surprise.  
“‘Your son went to serve at a distant place, and became a 
centurion. He was just and good. One afternoon, one of his servants 
fell ill, and it appeared that he would die. Your son had heard of a 
rabbi who was able to cure illnesses, and  he rode out for days and 
days in search of this man. Along the way, he learned that the man 
he was seeking was the Son of God. He met others who had been 
cured by him, and they instructed your son in the man’s teachings. 
And so, despite the fact that he w as a Roman centurion, he 
converted to their faith. Shortly thereafter, he reached the place 
where the man he was looking for was visiting.’  
“‘He told the man that one of his servants was gravely ill, and the 
rabbi made ready to go to his house with him. Bu t the centurion was 
a man of faith, and, looking into the eyes of the rabbi, he knew that 
he was surely in the presence of the Son of God.’  
“‘And this is what your son said,’ the angel told the man. ‘These 
are the words he said to the rabbi at that point, and they have never been forgotten: “My Lord, I am not worthy that you should come 
under my roof. But only speak a word and my servant will be 
healed.””’  
The alchemist said, “No matter what he does, every person on 
earth plays a central role in the history  of the world. And normally 
he doesn’t know it.”  
The boy smiled. He had never imagined that questions about life 
would be of such importance to a shepherd.  
“Good -bye,” the alchemist said.  
“Good -bye,” said the boy.  
 
 
 
THE BOY RODE ALONG THROUGH THE DESERT F OR SEVERAL  hours, listening 
avidly to what his heart had to say. It was his heart that would tell 
him where his treasure was hidden.  
“Where your treasure is, there also will be your heart,” the 
alchemist had told him.  
But his heart was speaking of other th ings. With pride, it told the 
story of a shepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had 
on two different occasions. It told of Personal Legend, and of the 
many men who had wandered in search of distant lands or beautiful 
women, confronting the pe ople of their times with their 
preconceived notions. It spoke of journeys, discoveries, books, and 
change.  
As he was about to climb yet another dune, his heart whispered, 
“Be aware of the place where you are brought to tears. That’s where 
I am, and that’s where your treasure is.”  
The boy climbed the dune slowly. A full moon rose again in the 
starry sky: it had been a month since he had set forth from the oasis. The moonlight cast shadows through the dunes, creating the 
appearance of a rolling sea; it remind ed the boy of the day when 
that horse had reared in the desert, and he had come to know the 
alchemist. And the moon fell on the desert’s silence, and on a man’s 
journey in search of treasure.  
When he reached the top of the dune, his heart leapt. There, 
illuminated by the light of the moon and the brightness of the 
desert, stood the solemn and majestic Pyramids of Egypt.  
The boy fell to his knees and wept. He thanked God for making 
him believe in his Personal Legend, and for leading him to meet a 
king, a mer chant, an Englishman, and an alchemist. And above all 
for his having met a woman of the desert who had told him that love 
would never keep a man from his Personal Legend.  
If he wanted to, he could now return to the oasis, go back to 
Fatima, and live his life as a simple shepherd. After all, the alchemist 
continued to live in the desert, even though he understood the 
Language of the World, and knew how to transform lead into gold. 
He didn’t need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone. The 
boy told hi mself that, on the way toward realizing his own Personal 
Legend, he had learned all he needed to know, and had experienced 
everything he might have dreamed of.  
But here he was, at the point of finding his treasure, and he 
reminded himself that no project i s completed until its objective has 
been achieved. The boy looked at the sands around him, and saw 
that, where his tears had fallen, a scarab beetle was scuttling 
through the sand. During his time in the desert, he had learned that, 
in Egypt, the scarab be etles are a symbol of God.  
Another omen! The boy began to dig into the dune. As he did so, 
he thought of what the crystal merchant had once said: that anyone could build a pyramid in his backyard. The boy could see now that 
he couldn’t do so if he placed s tone upon stone for the rest of his life.  
Throughout the night, the boy dug at the place he had chosen, 
but found nothing. He felt weighted down by the centuries of time 
since the Pyramids had been built. But he didn’t stop. He struggled 
to continue diggin g as he fought the wind, which often blew the 
sand back into the excavation. His hands were abraded and 
exhausted, but he listened to his heart. It had told him to dig where 
his tears fell.  
As he was attempting to pull out the rocks he encountered, he 
hear d footsteps. Several figures approached him. Their backs were 
to the moonlight, and the boy could see neither their eyes nor their 
faces.  
“What are you doing here?” one of the figures demanded.  
Because he was terrified, the boy didn’t answer. He had found 
where his treasure was, and was frightened at what might happen.  
“We’re refugees from the tribal wars, and we need money,” the 
other figure said. “What are you hiding there?”  
“I’m not hiding anything,” the boy answered.  
But one of them seized the boy and y anked him back out of the 
hole. Another, who was searching the boy’s bags, found the piece of 
gold.  
“There’s gold here,” he said.  
The moon shone on the face of the Arab who had seized him, and 
in the man’s eyes the boy saw death.  
“He’s probably got more gold hidden in the ground.”  
They made the boy continue digging, but he found nothing. As 
the sun rose, the men began to beat the boy. He was bruised and 
bleeding, his clothing was torn to shreds, and he felt that death was 
near.  “What good is money to you if you’re going to die? It’s not often 
that money can save someone’s life,” the alchemist had said. Finally, 
the boy screamed at the men, “I’m digging for treasure!” And, 
although his mouth was bleeding and swollen, he told his attackers 
that he had twice dreamed of a treasure hidden near the Pyramids 
of Egypt.  
The man who appeared to be the leader of the group spoke to 
one of the others: “Leave him. He doesn’t have anything else. He 
must have stolen this gold.”  
The boy fell to the sand, nearly unconscious.  The leader shook 
him and said, “We’re leaving.”  
But before they left, he came back to the boy and said, “You’re 
not going to die. You’ll live, and you’ll learn that a man shouldn’t be 
so stupid. Two years ago, right here on this spot, I had a recurrent 
dream, too. I dreamed that I should travel to the fields of Spain and 
look for a ruined church where shepherds and their sheep slept. In 
my dream, there was a sycamore growing out of the ruins of the 
sacristy, and I was told that, if I dug at the roots of th e sycamore, I 
would find a hidden treasure. But I’m not so stupid as to cross an 
entire desert just because of a recurrent dream.”  
And they disappeared.  
The boy stood up shakily, and looked once more at the 
Pyramids. They seemed to laugh at him, and he lau ghed back, his 
heart bursting with joy.  
Because now he knew where his treasure was.  
  
EPILOGUE  
 
 
THE BOY REACHED THE SMALL, ABANDONED CHURCH JUST  as night was 
falling. The sycamore was still there in the sacristy, and the stars 
could still be seen through the half -destroyed roof. He remembered 
the time he had been there with his sheep; it had been a peaceful 
night…except for the dream.  
Now he was here not with his flock, but with a s hovel.  
He sat looking at the sky for a long time. Then he took from his 
knapsack a bottle of wine, and drank some. He remembered the 
night in the desert when he had sat with the alchemist, as they 
looked at the stars and drank wine together. He thought of the many 
roads he had traveled, and of the strange way God had chosen to 
show him his treasure. If he hadn’t believed in the significance of 
recurrent dreams, he would not have met the Gypsy woman, the 
king, the thief, or…“Well, it’s a long list. But the p ath was written in 
the omens, and there was no way I could go wrong,” he said to 
himself.  
He fell asleep, and when he awoke the sun was already high. He 
began to dig at the base of the sycamore.  
“You old sorcerer,” the boy shouted up to the sky. “You knew the 
whole story. You even left a bit of gold at the monastery so I could 
get back to this church. The monk laughed when he saw me come 
back in tatters. Couldn’t you have saved me from that?”  
“No,” he heard a voice on the wind say. “If I had told you, you 
wouldn’t have seen the Pyramids. They’re beautiful, aren’t they?”  The boy smiled, and continued digging. Half an hour later, his 
shovel hit something solid. An hour later, he had before him a chest 
of Spanish gold coins. There were also precious stones, gol d masks 
adorned with red and white feathers, and stone statues embedded 
with jewels. The spoils of a conquest that the country had long ago 
forgotten, and that some conquistador had failed to tell his children 
about.  
The boy took out Urim and Thummim from his bag. He had used 
the two stones only once, one morning when he was at a 
marketplace. His life and his path had always provided him with 
enough omens.  
He placed Urim and Thummim in the chest. They were also a 
part of his new treasure, because they were a reminder of the old 
king, whom he would never see again.  
It’s true; life really is generous to those who pursue their 
Personal Legend, the boy thought. Then he remembered that he had 
to get to Tarifa so he could give one -tenth of his treasure to the 
Gyps y woman, as he had promised. Those Gypsies are really smart, 
he thought. Maybe it was because they moved around so much.  
The wind began to blow again. It was the levanter, the wind that 
came from Africa. It didn’t bring with it the smell of the desert, nor  
the threat of Moorish invasion. Instead, it brought the scent of a 
perfume he knew well, and the touch of a kiss —a kiss that came 
from far away, slowly, slowly, until it rested on his lips.  
The boy smiled. It was the first time she had done that.  
“I’m coming, Fatima,” he said.  
  
ABOUT THE AUTHOR   
 
 
PAULO  COELHO  was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the city where 
he now lives. His own life has in many ways been as varied and 
unusual as the protagonists of his interna tionally acclaimed novels. 
Like them, Paulo Coelho has followed a dream in a quest for 
fulfillment. His own dream, to be a writer, met with frustration 
throughout much of his early adult life, a time in which he worked at 
various professions, some of them materially rewarding but 
spiritually unfulfilling. “I always knew,” he says, “that my Personal 
Legend, to use a term from alchemy, was to write.” He was thirty -
eight when he published his first book.  
In 1970, after deciding that law school was not for him,  he 
traveled through much of South America, North Africa, Mexico, and 
Europe. Returning to Brazil after two years, he began a successful 
career as popular songwriter. In 1974, he was imprisoned for a short 
time by the military dictatorship then ruling in B razil. In 1980, he 
experienced one of the defining moments of his life: he walked the 
five hundred -plus mile Road of Santiago de Compostela in 
northwestern Spain. On this ancient highway, used for centuries by 
pilgrims from France to get to the cathedral s aid to house the 
remains of St. James, he achieved a self -awareness and a spiritual 
awakening that he later described in The Pilgrimage.  
Paulo Coelho once said that following your dream is like 
learning a foreign language; you will make mistakes but you will get 
there in the end. In 1988, he published The Alchemist , a novel that explores this theme, and it launched him as an international 
bestselling author. Specifically, Paulo Coelho is recognized for his 
powerful storytelling technique and the profound spiritual insights 
he blends seamlessly into his parables. Since then, The Alchemist  has 
sold more than twenty million copies worldwide and  has been 
translated into some fifty -six languages. In addition to The 
Pilgrimage  and The Alchemist , Paulo Coelho has written luminous 
novels about the different streams of our lives, including By the 
River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept , The Valkyries , The Fi fth Mountain , 
and Veronika Decides to Die . A winner of numerous literary prizes, 
Paulo Coelho is also a prominent speaker for humanitarian causes. 
In 1999, he received a Crystal Award for Artistic Achievement at the 
Davos Economic Forum Conference.  
  
International Acclaim  for Paulo Coelho’s  
The Alchemist  
 
“The story has the comic charm, dramatic tension, and 
psychological intensity of a fairy tale, but it’s full of specific wisdom 
as well…. A sweetly exotic tale f or young and old alike.”  
—Publishers Weekly  
 
“Beneath this novel’s compelling story and the shimmering 
elegance with which it’s told lies a bedrock of wisdom about 
following one’s heart.”  
—Booklist  
 
“As memorable and meaningful as Saint -Exupéry’s The Littl e 
Prince. ” 
—Austin American -Statesman  
 
“A touching, inspiring fable.”  
—Indianapolis Star  
 
“A little poke in the ribs from on high.”  
—Detroit Free Press  
 
“The Alchemist  is a fabulous success.”  
—Der Spiegel  (Germany)  
 “A remarkable tale about the most magical of all journeys: the 
quest to fulfill one’s destiny. I recommend The Alchemist  to anyone 
who is passionately committed to claiming the life of their dreams —
today.”  
—Anthony Robbins, author of  
Awaken the Giant Withi n 
 
“An entrepreneurial tale of universal wisdom we can apply to 
the business of our own lives.”  
—Spencer Johnson, M.D., author of  
Who Moved My Cheese  
 
“An adventure story full of magic and wisdom.”  
—Rudolfo Anaya, author of Bless Me, Ultima

treasures we seek elsewhere and then find at our doorstep.”  
—Madonna in Sonntag -Aktuell  (Germany)

wonder. This fable is a roseate amalgam of spiritual quest, 
existential puzzle, lovely sensitivity, and deep strength.”  
—Malcolm Boyd, author of  
Are You Running with Me, Jesus?  
 
“Paulo Coelho knows the secret of l iterary alchemy.”  
—Kenzaburo Oé, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature  
 “A most tender and gentle story. It is a rare gem of a book, and 
will most certainly touch the very core of every heart earnestly 
seeking its own destiny on the journey of life.”  
—Gerald G. Jampolsky, M.D., coauthor of  
Change Your Mind, Change Your Life  and Love Is Letting Go of Fear  
 
“Rarely do I come across a story with the directness and 
simplicity of Coelho’s The Alchemist.  It lifts the reader out of time 
and focuses through a bel ievably unlikely story on a young dreamer 
looking for himself. A beautiful story with a pointed message for 
every reader.”  
—Joseph Girzone, author of Joshua  
 
“This is the type of book that makes you understand more about 
yourself and about life. It has philosophy, and is spiced with colors, 
flavors and subjects, like a fairy tale. A lovely book.”  
—Yedi’ot Aharonot  (Israel)  
 
“A boy named Santiago joins the ranks of Candide and Pinocchio 
by taking us on a very excellent adventure.”  
—Paul Zindel, author of the Pulitzer Prize –winning play,  
The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man -in-the-Moon Marigolds  
 
“The mystic quality in the odd adventures of the boy, Santiago, 
may bring not only him but others who read this fine book closer to 
recognizing and reaching their own i nner destinies.”  
—Charlotte Zolotow, author of If You Listen  
 “Paulo Coelho gives you the inspiration to follow your own 
dreams by seeing the world through your own eyes and not 
someone else’s.”  
—Lynn Andrews, author of the Medicine Woman series  
 
“Nothing is impossible, such is Coelho’s message, as long as you 
wish it with all your heart. No other book bears so much hope, small 
wonder its author became a guru among all those in search of the 
meaning of life.”  
—Focus  (Germany)  
 
“The Alchemist  is a truly poet ic book.”  
—Welt am Sonntag  (Germany)  
 
“Dotted throughout the story and illuminated in a poetic style 
are metaphors and deep insights that stir our imagination and 
transport the reader on a fantastic journey of the soul.”  
—Yomiuri -Shinbun  (Japan)  
 
“The Alch emist  brings to mind The Little Prince  by Saint -Exupéry 
and The Prophet  by Khalil Gibran, as well as biblical parables.”  
—Gazeta Wymborcza  (Poland)  
 
“The Alchemist  is a beautiful and heartwarming story with an 
exotic flavor…. You may or may not agree with PauloCoelho’s 
philosophy, but it’s nonetheless a tale that comforts our hearts as 
much as our souls.”  
—Bergensavisen  (Norway)  
 “The Alchemist  is like a modern -day The Little Prince.  A supreme 
and simple book.”  
—Milorad Pavic  (Serbia)  
 
“Among Latin American  writers, only Columbia’s Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez is more widely read than Brazil’s Paulo Coelho.”  
—The Economist

Brazilian journalist phoned to say that President Clinton had been Roberts declaring that she adored the book. Walking alone down a The Alchemist!” What’s the secret behind such a huge success? that God chose for you here on Earth. Whenever we do something we don’t all have the courage to confront our own dream. Why? There are four obstacles. First: we are told from childhood onward that everything we want to do is impossible. We grow up calling is so deeply buried in our soul as to be invisible. But it’s still there. afraid of hurting those around us by abandoning everything in order to pursue our dream. We do not realize that love is just a We do not realize that those who genuinely wish us well want us to be happy and are prepared to accompany us on that journey. against the third obstacle: fear of the defeats we will meet on the didn’t really want it anyway.” We do want it and know that we have staked everything on it and that the path of the personal calling is patience in difficult times and to know that the Universe is I ask myself: are defeats necessary? up eight times. only going to suffer more than other people? do—we are filled by a greater sense of euphoria and confidence. In unexpected suffering passes more quickly than suffering that is to free ourselves from the bitterness and it stays with us for the rest of our lives. the very next day. Then comes the fourth obstacle: the fear of realizing the dream for which we fought all our lives. Oscar Wilde said: “Each man kills the thing he loves.” And it’s true. The mere possibility of getting what we want fills the soul of the ordinary person with guilt. We look around at all those who have failed to get what they want and feel that we do not deserve to get what we want either. We forget about all the obstacles we series of stupid mistakes and never reached their goal—when it was only a step away. This is the most dangerous of the obstacles because it has a kind of saintly aura about it: renouncing joy and conquest. But if you and you understand why you are here.

Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed. But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one they would reach in about four days. He had been to the village only until the afternoon. So the boy sat on the steps of the shop and took a book from his bag. behind him. each day was like all the others. The shepherd told her of the where he had stopped. It was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep. “How did you learn to read?” the girl asked at one point. The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question. He was sure the girl would never days. He recognized that he was feeling something he had never experienced before: the desire to live in one place forever. With the four sheep.

It’s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life there was an old woman who interpreted dreams. THE OLD WOMAN LED THE BOY TO A ROOM AT THE BACK of her house; it was separated from her living room by a curtain of colored beads. The It sounded like a Gypsy prayer. The boy had already had had no flocks of sheep.

He was going to be able to save the little money he had because of a dream about hidden treasure! your treasure in exchange for what I am going to tell you.” The shepherd swore that he would. The old woman asked him to swear again while looking at the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. that I deserve a part of what you find. “And this is my interpretation: you must go to the Pyramids in you a rich man.” out the old woman for this! But then he remembered that he wasn’t going to have to pay anything. “I told you that your dream was a difficult one. It’s the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary; only wise men are “I only interpret dreams. I don’t know how to turn them into reality. That’s why I have to live off what my daughters provide me with.” “And what if I never get to Egypt?” “Then I don’t get paid. It wouldn’t be the first time.” wasted too much time with him. So the boy was disappointed; he decided that he would never again believe in dreams.

He no longer had to seek out food and water for the sheep; he could as much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books. He walked slowly through the market.

It’s not often that money saves a person’s life.” But the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom. He had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind.

<pre>&#39;ALCHEMIST PAULO COELHO TRANSLATED BY ALAN R . CLARKE Contents INTRODUCTION I remember receiving a letter from the American publisher Harper Collins … PROLOGUE The alchemist picked up a book that someone in the … ONE The boy ’ s name was Santiago . Dusk was falling as the … TWO The boy had been working for the crystal merchant for … EPILOGUE church just as night … ABOUT THE AUTHOR INTERNATIONAL ACCLAIM BOOKS BY PAULO COELHO CREDITS COVER COPYRIGHT ABOUT THE PUBLISHER TEN YEARS ON I REMEMBER RECEIVING A LETTER FROM THE AMERICAN publisher Harper Collins that said that : “ reading The Alchemist was like getting up at dawn and seeing the sun rise while the rest of the world still slept . ” I struggling to establish myself as a writer and to follow my path despite all the voices telling me it was impossible . Brazilian journalist phoned to say that President Clinton had been Roberts declaring that she adored the book . Walking alone down a The Alchemist ! ” What ’ s the secret behind such a huge success ? that God chose for you here on Earth . Whenever we do something we don ’ t all have the courage to confront our own dream . Why ? There are four obstacles . First : we are told from childhood onward that everything we want to do is impossible . We grow up calling is so deeply buried in our soul as to be invisible . But it ’ s still there . afraid of hurting those around us by abandoning everything in order to pursue our dream . We do not realize that love is just a We do not realize that those who genuinely wish us well want us to be happy and are prepared to accompany us on that journey . against the third obstacle : fear of the defeats we will meet on the didn ’ t really want it anyway . ” We do want it and know that we have staked everything on it and that the path of the personal calling is patience in difficult times and to know that the Universe is I ask myself : are defeats necessary ? up eight times . only going to suffer more than other people ? do — we are filled by a greater sense of euphoria and confidence . In unexpected suffering passes more quickly than suffering that is to free ourselves from the bitterness and it stays with us for the rest of our lives . the very next day . Then comes the fourth obstacle : the fear of realizing the dream for which we fought all our lives . Oscar Wilde said : “ Each man kills the thing he loves . ” And it ’ s true . The mere possibility of getting what we want fills the soul of the ordinary person with guilt . We look around at all those who have failed to get what they want and feel that we do not deserve to get what we want either . We forget about all the obstacles we series of stupid mistakes and never reached their goal — when it was only a step away . This is the most dangerous of the obstacles because it has a kind of saintly aura about it : renouncing joy and conquest . But if you and you understand why you are here . Paulo Coelho Rio de Janeiro November 2002 Translated by Margaret Jull Costa PROLOGUE Translated by Clifford E . Landers THE ALCHEMIST PICKED UP A BOOK THAT SOMEONE IN THE caravan had Narcissus . daily beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty . He was so called the narcissus . But this was not how the author of the book ended the story . transformed into a lake of salty tears . “ Why do you weep ? ” the goddesses asked . contemplate his beauty close at hand . ” “ But … was Narcissus beautiful ? ” the lake asked . “ Who better than you to know that ? ” the goddesses said in contemplate himself ! ” PART ONE THE BOY ’ S NAME WAS SANTIAGO . DUSK WAS FALLING AS the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church . The roof had fallen in long sacristy had once stood . He decided to spend the night there . He saw to it that all the across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night . searching for it . he had just finished reading as a pillow . He told himself that he made more comfortable pillows . the stars through the half-destroyed roof . before it ended . animals also began to stir . It was as if some mysterious energy could be the other way around : that it was he who had become accustomed to their schedule . But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken . name . He had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said . So there were times when he read them would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in the fields . Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed . But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one they would reach in about four days . He had been to the village only until the afternoon . So the boy sat on the steps of the shop and took a book from his bag . behind him . each day was like all the others . The shepherd told her of the where he had stopped . It was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep . “ How did you learn to read ? ” the girl asked at one point . The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question . He was sure the girl would never days . He recognized that he was feeling something he had never experienced before : the desire to live in one place forever . With the four sheep . He paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year . AND NOW IT WAS ONLY FOUR DAYS BEFORE HE WOULD BE back in that same selling their wool . other places . ” But in his heart he knew that it did matter . And he knew that town where there was someone who could make them forget the joys of carefree wandering . thought . Maybe that ’ s why they always stay close to me . The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water . seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk ; and they had the boy told them about the sights of the cities . They were content nourishment . him to feel anger toward his faithful companions . He drank a bit and he gathered his jacket closer to his body . He knew that a few great that he would not be able to lead his flock across the fields . It was the time of day when all of Spain slept during the summer . The jacket . But when he thought to complain about the burden of its withstood the cold of the dawn . grateful for the jacket ’ s weight and warmth . explain to the girl how it was that a simple shepherd knew how to read . That he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen . His pride for a simple farm family . They worked hard just to have food didn ’ t want to become a priest . That he wanted to travel . they leave they are basically the same people they were when they thinking that the past was better than what we have now . They have who live right here . ” boy explained . son . who travel are the shepherds . ” that held three ancient Spanish gold coins . “ I found these one day in the fields . I wanted them to be a part of women are the most beautiful . ” And he gave the boy his blessing . The boy could see in his happy ; he had already seen many castles and met many women ( but none the equal of the one who awaited him several days hence ) . He through those parts many times . The world was huge and inexhaustible ; he had only to allow his sheep to set the route for a is that they don ’ t even realize that they ’ re walking a new road every day . They don ’ t see that the fields are new and the seasons change . All they think about is food and water . thought of other women since I met the merchant ’ s daughter . had arrived there before him and asked for her hand . It ’ s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life there was an old woman who interpreted dreams . THE OLD WOMAN LED THE BOY TO A ROOM AT THE BACK of her house ; it was separated from her living room by a curtain of colored beads . The It sounded like a Gypsy prayer . The boy had already had had no flocks of sheep . People said that Gypsies spent their lives always been frightened to death that he would be captured by his hands in hers . showing the old woman that he was fearful . He recited an Our Father silently . the woman sensed it . He quickly pulled his hands away . regretting having come . He thought for a moment that it would be giving too much importance to his recurrent dream . old woman . “ And dreams are the language of God . When he speaks and that ’ s what makes a shepherd ’ s life exciting . sheep are afraid of strangers . But children always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them . I don ’ t know why . I don ’ t know how animals know the age of human beings . ” give you a lot of time . ” both hands and transported me to the Egyptian pyramids . ” He paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the Egyptian pyramids were . But she said nothing . times . ” The woman was silent for some time . Then she again took his hands and studied them carefully . The boy laughed — out of happiness . He was going to be able to save the little money he had because of a dream about hidden treasure ! your treasure in exchange for what I am going to tell you . ” The shepherd swore that he would . The old woman asked him to swear again while looking at the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus . that I deserve a part of what you find . “ And this is my interpretation : you must go to the Pyramids in you a rich man . ” out the old woman for this ! But then he remembered that he wasn ’ t going to have to pay anything . “ I told you that your dream was a difficult one . It ’ s the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary ; only wise men are “ I only interpret dreams . I don ’ t know how to turn them into reality . That ’ s why I have to live off what my daughters provide me with . ” “ And what if I never get to Egypt ? ” “ Then I don ’ t get paid . It wouldn ’ t be the first time . ” wasted too much time with him . So the boy was disappointed ; he decided that he would never again believe in dreams . He remembered that he had a number of things he had to take care of : he went to the market for something bench in the plaza where he could sample the new wine he had The boy knew a lot of people in the city . That was what made need to spend all of his time with them . When someone sees the they wind up becoming a part of that person ’ s life . And then they want the person to change . If someone isn ’ t what others want them her own . He decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky before following his flock back through the fields . Three days from He started to read the book he had bought . On the very first page it described a burial ceremony . And the names of the people reader wouldn ’ t have to worry about memorizing a lot of names . down at his side and tried to strike up a conversation . in the plaza . wanted to concentrate on his reading . who was capable of doing difficult things . He had already imagined he explained that the sheep had to be sheared from back to front . He also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared them as if they were from his personal experience . She would never hoping that the old man would leave him alone . ashamed and decide of his own accord to change benches . irritating . ” “ It ’ s a book that says the same thing almost all the other books in inability to choose their own Personal Legends . And it ends up saying that everyone believes the world ’ s greatest lie . ” surprised . That ’ s the world ’ s greatest lie . ” travel . ” want to return it at all . The boy noticed that the man ’ s clothing was parts . Africa was only a few hours from Tarifa ; one had only to cross shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day . “ Where are you from ? ” the boy asked . “ From many places . ” from a city near an ancient castle . That ’ s where I was born . ” fearing that he would appear ignorant . He looked at the people in seemed to be very busy . “ It ’ s like it always has been . ” No clue yet . But he knew that Salem wasn ’ t in Andalusia . If it “ And what do you do in Salem ? ” he insisted . king of Salem ! ” alone with one ’ s books . They tell their incredible stories at the time they say some things that are so strange that you don ’ t know how to continue the conversation . do you have ? ” know more about his life . you ’ ve got enough sheep . ” The boy was getting irritated . He wasn ’ t asking for help . It was the conversation . sheep and get going . ” you how to find the hidden treasure . ” old man — maybe he was her husband — was going to find a way to get much more money in exchange for information about something Something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded . With a movement that was too read what the old man had written in the sand . names of his father and his mother and the name of the seminary he awed and embarrassed . “ For several reasons . But let ’ s say that the most important is that you have succeeded in discovering your Personal Legend . ” The boy didn ’ t know what a person ’ s “ Personal Legend ” was . impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend . ” None of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy . But he wanted to know what the “ mysterious force ” was ; the merchant ’ s daughter would be impressed when he told her about that ! how to realize your Personal Legend . It prepares your spirit and universe . It ’ s your mission on earth . ” “ Even when all you want to do is travel ? Or marry the daughter of a textile merchant ? ” and jealousy . To realize one ’ s Personal Legend is a person ’ s only real obligation . All things are one . helping you to achieve it . ” townspeople . It was the old man who spoke first . “ Why do you tend a flock of sheep ? ” “ Because I like to travel . ” The old man pointed to a baker standing in his shop window at shepherds sleep out in the open . Parents would rather see their children marry bakers than shepherds . ” daughter . There was surely a baker in her town . about shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them than their own Personal Legends . ” as he himself had been interrupted . “ Why are you telling me all this ? ” “ Because you are trying to realize your Personal Legend . And you are at the point where you ’ re about to give it all up . ” “ And that ’ s when you always appear on the scene ? ” people don ’ t realize I ’ ve done them . ” had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds . For five years thousands of stones looking for an emerald . The miner was about to more stone — just one more — he would find his emerald . Since the decided to become involved . He transformed himself into a stone it aside . But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone beautiful emerald in the world . The boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure . flock . ” “ What about one-tenth of my treasure ? ” The old man looked disappointed . “ If you start out by promising toward getting it . ” The boy told him that he had already promised to give one-tenth of his treasure to the Gypsy . life has its price . This is what the Warriors of the Light try to teach . ” The old man returned the book to the boy . And I will tell you how to find the hidden treasure . Good afternoon . ” And he vanished around the corner of the plaza . man was right . He went over to the bakery and bought a loaf of the old man had said about him . Sometimes it ’ s better to leave the way things were . The boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the baker . So he began to wander through the he knew that Egypt was in Africa . “ Can I help you ? ” asked the man behind the window . strait . The idea frightened him . watching the boy walk away . “ He doesn ’ t have enough money to travel . ” years he had learned everything about shepherding : he knew how the sheep from wolves . He knew all the fields and pastures of Andalusia . And he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals . He decided to return to his friend ’ s stable by the longest route all of Spain . the plaza where he had talked with the old man . Curse the moment I a woman who could interpret his dream . Neither the woman nor the old man was at all impressed by the fact that he was a shepherd . and didn ’ t understand that shepherds become attached to their sheep . He knew everything about each member of his flock : he The wind began to pick up . He knew that wind : people called it the eastern end of the Mediterranean . something he had become accustomed to and something he wanted didn ’ t even remember him . He was sure that it made no difference recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises . to come and go from the baker ’ s shop . A young couple sat on the brought the smell of the desert and of veiled women . It had brought with it the sweat and the dreams of men who had once left to search that he could have the same freedom . There was nothing to hold the fields of Andalusia were only steps along the way to his Personal Legend . sheep with him . sheep immediately . He said that he had always dreamed of being a almost sure to win . Beginner ’ s luck . ” “ Why is that ? ” “ Because there is a force that wants you to realize your Personal Legend ; it whets your appetite with a taste of success . ” wool . “ Where is the treasure ? ” he asked . The boy was startled . The old woman had said the same thing . But she hadn ’ t charged him anything . God has prepared a path for everyone to follow . You just have to read the omens that he left for you . ” between him and the old man . He remembered something his grandfather had once told him : that butterflies were a good omen . clovers . “ Just as your grandfather taught you . These are good omens . ” precious stones . The boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day . He really was a king ! He must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves . black stone that had been embedded at the center of the breastplate . “ They are called Urim and Thummim . The black question . at the Pyramids ; that you already knew . But I had to insist on the payment of six sheep because I helped you to make your decision . ” make his own decisions . “ Don ’ t forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and don ’ t forget to follow your Personal Legend through to its conclusion . “ A certain shopkeeper sent his son to learn about the secret of happiness from the wisest man in the world . The lad wandered of the most delicious food in that part of the world . The wise man before it was his turn to be given the man ’ s attention . “ The wise man listened attentively to the boy ’ s explanation of explain the secret of happiness . He suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in two hours . to spill . ’ “ The boy began climbing and descending the many stairways of returned to the room where the wise man was . that are hanging in my dining hall ? Did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create ? Did you notice the beautiful parchments in my library ? ’ nothing . His only concern had been not to spill the oil that the wise man had entrusted to him . wise man . ‘ You cannot trust a man if you don ’ t know his house . ’ related in detail everything he had seen . “ ‘ But where are the drops of oil I entrusted to you ? ’ asked the wise man . gone . wisest of wise men . ‘ The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels The shepherd said nothing .

Melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out seen Abraham again after having charged him his one-tenth fee . That was his work . Personal Legends . But the king of Salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful . thought . I should have repeated it for him . Then when he spoke sometimes has to take some pride in himself . ” He was sitting in a bar very much like the other bars he had seen along the narrow streets of Tangier . Some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other . In just a few chanted — as everyone about him went to their knees and placed their foreheads on the ground . had always looked at the image of Saint Santiago Matamoros on his kneeling at his feet . The boy felt ill and terribly alone . The infidels had an evil look about them . time : only Arabic was spoken in this country . drink that had been served at the next table . It turned out to be a bitter tea . The boy preferred wine . But he didn ’ t need to worry about that right now . What he had about getting it . The sale of his sheep had left him with enough man had known what he was talking about : during the time the boy which path he should take by observing the ground and the sky . He had discovered that the presence of a certain bird meant that a was water in the area . The sheep had taught him that . “ Who are you ? ” he heard a voice ask him in Spanish . someone had appeared . “ How come you speak Spanish ? ” he asked . The new arrival was a was from this city . He was about the same age and height as the boy . “ Almost everyone here speaks Spanish . We ’ re only two hours from Spain . ” ask for a glass of wine for me . I hate this tea . ” religion here forbids it . ” The boy told him then that he needed to get to the Pyramids . He payment for taking him there . He remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn ’ t even have yet . “ I ’ d like you to take me there if you can . I can pay you to serve as my guide . ” “ Do you have any idea how to get there ? ” the newcomer asked . listening attentively to their conversation . He felt uneasy at the out on an opportunity . enough . ” The boy thought it a strange question . But he trusted in the old universe always conspires in your favor . He took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young irritated . leave . ” grabbed him and began to speak to him in an angry stream of has its thieves . ” The boy trusted his new friend . He had helped him out in a dangerous situation . He took out his money and counted it . taking the money . “ But I have to buy two camels . ” They walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier . Everywhere there were stalls with items for sale . They reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held . There were that would be unfriendly . He knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in . than his friend . most beautiful sword he had ever seen . The scabbard was embossed to his friend . Then he realized that he had been distracted for a few he knew what he would find . He continued to look at the beautiful around . could he find his new companion . The boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident . He decided to stay right there and nearby tower and began his chant ; everyone in the market fell to stalls and left . houses surrounding the plaza . He recalled that when the sun had morning he had known everything that was going to happen to him where he couldn ’ t even speak the language . He was no longer a start everything over . could have changed so suddenly and so drastically . He was so ashamed that he wanted to cry . He had never even and because this was the way God repaid those who believed in their dreams . now I ’ m sad and alone . I ’ m going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me . I ’ m going to hate those who have found their treasure because I never found mine . And I ’ m conquer the world . He opened his pouch to see what was left of his possessions ; maybe there was a bit left of the sandwich he had eaten on the ship . the old man had given him . had exchanged six sheep for two precious stones that had been taken from a gold breastplate . He could sell the stones and buy a removing them from the pouch so he could put them in his pocket . him was that port towns are full of thieves . Now he understood why the owner of the bar had been so upset : he was trying to tell him not to trust that man . “ I ’ m like everyone not what actually does . ” temperature and feeling their surfaces . They were his treasure . Just handling them made him feel better . They reminded him of the old man . The boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man stones were proof that he had met with a king — a king who knew of the boy ’ s past . read the omens . ” The boy put the stones back in the pouch and decided to do an experiment . The old man had said to ask very clear he asked if the old man ’ s blessing was still with him . He took out one of the stones . It was “ yes . ” “ Am I going to find my treasure ? ” he asked . pouch and fell to the ground . The boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch . He knelt down to find Urim and Thummim and put them back in the pouch . But as he saw them lying said . An omen . The boy smiled to himself . He picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch . He didn ’ t consider mending the hole — the stones could fall through any time they wanted . He so as not to flee from one ’ s own Personal Legend . “ I promised that I and that made him feel more confident . He looked around at the strange place ; it was a new one . thought . Although his new world at the moment was just an empty and he would never forget it . He remembered the sword . It hurt him between thinking of himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an adventurer in quest of his treasure . HE WAS SHAKEN INTO WAKEFULNESS BY SOMEONE . HE had fallen asleep in resume . He no longer had to seek out food and water for the sheep ; he could as much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books . He walked slowly through the market . The merchants were reminded the boy of the old man — the mysterious old king he had met . “ This candy merchant isn ’ t making candy so that later he can travel or marry a shopkeeper ’ s daughter . He ’ s doing it because it ’ s the same thing the old man had done — sense whether a person was near to or far from his Personal Legend . Just by looking at them . It ’ s spoken Arabic and the other Spanish . And they had understood each other perfectly well . it ’ s happening with people . He was learning a lot of new things . Some of them were things had never perceived before . And he hadn ’ t perceived them because he had become accustomed to them . He realized : If I can learn to the world . the narrow streets of Tangier . Only in that way would he be able to his sheep . that he felt every morning . He had been in the same place for thirty years : a shop at the top of a hilly street where few customers passed . Now it was too late to change anything — the only thing he had ever learned to do was to buy and sell crystal glassware . There had been a time when many people knew of his shop : Arab were always well-heeled . In those days it had been wonderful to be have beautiful women at his side as he grew older . on the hill . And no one was going to climb the hill just to browse through a few small shops . But the crystal merchant had no choice . He had lived thirty years to do anything else . He spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings practiced eyes of the crystal merchant could see that the boy had no lunch for a few minutes until the boy moved on . A CARD HANGING IN THE DOORWAY ANNOUNCED THAT several languages were spoken in the shop . The boy saw a man appear behind the counter . them . ” The man looked at him without responding . entered the shop and bought some crystal . merchant . laughed . requires me to feed a hungry person . ” “ Because the crystal was dirty . And both you and I needed to cleanse our minds of negative thoughts . ” “ I ’ d like you to work in my shop . Two customers came in today really don ’ t know what they ’ re saying . Just as I hadn ’ t realized that for so many years I had been speaking a language without words to my sheep . “ Do you want to go to work for me ? ” the merchant asked . The merchant laughed . “ Even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year … even if you earned a good commission selling every are thousands of kilometers of desert between here and there . ” There was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the Pyramids . It was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy ’ s that moment . The merchant looked anxiously at the boy . All the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared . picked up his pouch . some sheep . ” PART TWO THE BOY HAD BEEN WORKING FOR THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT for almost a would make him happy . The merchant spent the entire day pieces and not to break anything . some money aside . That morning he had done some calculating : if whole year to be able to buy some sheep . who pass at the bottom of the hill . ” might have died if we had come upon a snake . But that ’ s the way life is with sheep and with shepherds . ” The merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses . He was selling better than ever … as if time had turned back to the old days when the street had been one of Tangier ’ s major attractions . return to your sheep . Why ask more out of life ? ” the merchant had never met the king . said . But the merchant understood what the boy had said . The boy ’ s having hired the boy . The boy was being paid more money than he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep . away from the business of the display . saying nothing about his dream . The treasure was now nothing but “ I don ’ t know anyone around here who would want to cross the pile of stones . You could build one in your backyard . ” wait on a customer who had entered the shop . him much . But we two have to live with our mistakes . ” “ Why did you think we should have the display ? ” “ I want to get back to my sheep faster . We have to take doing to help us . It ’ s called the principle of favorability . Or beginner ’ s luck . ” during our lives . The most important is to believe only in the one He stopped there . His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the wanted to live his life in accordance with Muslim law . “ What ’ s the fifth obligation ? ” the boy asked . merchant answered . “ The fifth obligation of every Muslim is a holy city of Mecca . “ Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids . When I was leave someone in charge of the shop ; the crystals are delicate things . pilgrimage were poorer than I . “ All who went there were happy at having done so . They placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses . One of tired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his leather . ” “ Because it ’ s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive . That ’ s on living . want to dream about Mecca . I ’ ve already imagined a thousand times seven times I walk around it before allowing myself to touch it . I ’ ve dream about it . ” display . Not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way . now able to speak their strange language . Since that morning in the because Egypt was now just as distant a dream for him as was disembark at Tarifa as a winner . words … and about omens . One afternoon he had seen a man at the “ Let ’ s sell tea to the people who climb the hill . ” “ But we could sell tea in crystal glasses . The people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses . I have been told that beauty is the great seducer of men . ” “ What is it you ’ re looking for ? ” asked the old merchant . earn the money to do so . ” deeply . and everything else there is to know about crystal . I know its is going to expand . And then I ’ ll have to change my way of life . ” that it hasn ’ t been too bad . The shop is exactly the size I always know how to deal with change . I ’ m used to the way I am . ” didn ’ t see before : every blessing ignored becomes a curse . I don ’ t want anything else in life . But you are forcing me to look at wealth worse than I did before you arrived . Because I know the things I thought the boy to himself . They went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to himself for being able to do so . There had been a time when he thought that his sheep could teach him everything he needed to know about the world . But they could never have taught him Arabic . There are probably other things in the world that the sheep can ’ t “ What does that mean ? ” answered . “ But in your language it would be something like ‘ It is written . ’ ” there ’ s just no way to hold back the river . the top . But there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing beautiful crystal glasses . would be impressed by the beauty of the glassware . The other man remarked that tea was always more delicious when it was served in tradition in the Orient to use crystal glasses for tea because it had magical powers . climb the hill to see the shop that was doing something new in a trade that was so old . Other shops were opened that served tea in business . and his shop was sought out by men and women with a thirst for things new . THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN . IT HAD BEEN ELEVEN months and nine days since he had first set foot on the African continent . especially for this day . He put his headcloth in place and secured it descended the stairs silently . The city was still sleeping . He prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass . Then he sat in the sun-filled sound of the wind that brought the scent of the desert . When he had It was a bundle of money . Enough to buy himself a hundred and Africa into his own country . He waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop . Then the two went off to have some more tea . my sheep . And you have the money you need to go to Mecca . ” The old man said nothing . “ Will you give me your blessing ? ” asked the boy . “ You have Then he turned to the boy . crystal shop . But you know that I ’ m not going to go to Mecca . Just as you know that you ’ re not going to buy your sheep . ” And he gave the boy his blessing . THE BOY WENT TO HIS ROOM AND PACKED HIS BELONGINGS . They filled three and Thummim . realize how long it had been since he had thought of him . For nearly aside enough money so that he could return to Spain with pride . omens . ” strange sensation that the old king was nearby . He had worked hard thought . Even though the sheep didn ’ t teach me to speak Arabic . But the sheep had taught him something even more important : language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying for something believed in and desired . Tangier was no longer a could conquer the world . dreams are but don ’ t want to realize them . The old king hadn ’ t told could build one in his backyard . And he had forgotten to mention The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things . He went down the stairs and found the merchant waiting on a foreign tea from crystal glasses . It was more activity than usual for this time the old merchant ’ s hair was very much like the hair of the old king . had also been like the old king ’ s smile . trying to realize their Personal Legend . He left without saying good-bye to the crystal merchant . He didn ’ t want to cry with the other people there . He was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned . He was more the world . longer happy with his decision . He had worked for an entire year to becoming less important . Maybe because that wasn ’ t really his dream . Who knows … maybe it ’ s better to be like the crystal merchant : boy thought — he came to the bar he had entered on his first day tea . done . But maybe I ’ ll never have another chance to get to the an entire desert between him and the Pyramids . Yet the boy felt that there was another way to regard his situation : he was actually two hours closer to his treasure … the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn ’ t matter . all the time I need . Why not ? He suddenly felt tremendously happy . He could always go back to being a shepherd . He could always become a crystal salesman anyone ! He was planning as he left the bar . He had remembered that one of the crystal merchant ’ s suppliers transported his crystal by means of caravans that crossed the desert . He held Urim and Thummim in to his treasure . What could it cost to go over to the supplier ’ s warehouse and find out if the Pyramids were really that far away ? THE ENGLISHMAN WAS SITTING ON A BENCH IN A STRUCTURE that smelled of and here I am in a corral . But he had to move on . He believed in omens . All his life and all his studies were aimed at finding the one true language of the but his studies had taken him to a point beyond which he could not seem to go . He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an Work — the Philosopher ’ s Stone — and for this reason kept their knowledge to themselves . He had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his had purchased all the rarest and most important volumes on alchemist had visited Europe . It was said that he was more than two Stone and the Elixir of Life . The Englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story . But he would never have thought it more archaeological expedition in the desert — told him about an Arab that was possessed of exceptional powers . transform any metal into gold . ” The Englishman could not contain his excitement . He canceled all his commitments and pulled together the most important of his thought . And the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable . greeted the Englishman . “ Where are you bound ? ” asked the young Arab . his reading . He didn ’ t want any conversation at this point . What he the alchemist would certainly put him to the test . The young Arab took out a book and began to read . The book other important things to do . burial scene that began the book . “ I ’ ve been trying for two years to concentrate . He still had some doubts about the decision he had made . But he was able to understand one thing : making a decision was only the diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision . a mystery to me . off the conversation . The boy closed his book . He felt that he didn ’ t want to do anything that might make him look like the Englishman . He took In a flash the boy put them back in his pocket . the earth . But those who know about such things would know that those are Urim and Thummim . I didn ’ t know that they had them in this part of the world . ” “ Did you say a king ? ” he asked . “ I guess you don ’ t believe that a king would talk to someone like “ Not at all . It was shepherds who were the first to recognize a surprising that kings would talk to shepherds . ” me about Urim and Thummim . These stones were the only form of divination permitted by God . The priests carried them in a golden breastplate . ” The boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse . “ Who told you about omens ? ” The boy ’ s interest was increasing by the moment . have to find a man who knows that universal language . An alchemist . ” The conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss . leaving today for Al-Fayoum . ” you ? ” about the words luck and coincidence . It ’ s with those words that the universal language is written . ” He told the boy it was no coincidence that he had met him with were in search of the alchemist . regretted having said it . But the Englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it . the warehouse boss called to them to come outside . hold the power of life and death for every person I take with me . crazy . ” belts and rifles slung on their shoulders . The Englishman had the leader had to repeat himself several times for everyone to understand what he was saying . will do everything possible once again to win out over the desert . But I want each and every one of you to swear by the God you believe in that you will follow my orders no matter what . In the There was a murmur from the crowd . Each was swearing quietly to his or her own God . The boy swore to Jesus Christ . The Englishman said nothing . And the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have . The people were also praying to heaven for protection . uncertainly onto their backs . The boy felt sorry for the Englishman ’ s picking up the conversation where it had been interrupted in the warehouse . “ I ’ m here because a friend of mine heard of an Arab who … ” what the Englishman was saying . The boy knew what he was about boy . The caravan moved toward the east . It traveled during the spent most of his time with his books . The boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert . Now everything was quite different from mixed with the nervous orders of the guides and the merchants . and of the hoofbeats of the animals . Even the guides spoke very little to one another . remain silent . ” seems old and wise . had sat at the fort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face . It reminded him of the wool from his sheep … his sheep who were always had . probably already forgotten me . That ’ s good . Creatures like the probably wasn ’ t the only one . But he was excited at his intuitive understanding of the camel driver ’ s comment : maybe he was also learning the universal language that deals with the past and the boy was beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden was covered with the salt of dried-up lakes . The animals balked at unburden their charges . The drivers carried the freight themselves appoint a new one . But all this happened for one basic reason : no matter how many his books . first few days of the journey . But he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind . As soon as he had a superstition that each time he opened the book he would learn He became friendly with the camel driver who traveled to the driver his adventures as a shepherd . and that made me feel good . never to me . My neighbors feared they would lose all their olive children . I thought that everything I owned would be destroyed . living . So now I ’ m a camel driver . But that disaster taught me to understand the word of Allah : people need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want . our possessions and property . But this fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand . ” something that the other needed — as if everything were indeed the desert . were Bedouins who did surveillance along the caravan route . They provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes . They came fire where the Englishman and the boy were sitting . “ There are The three fell silent . The boy noted that there was a sense of fear experiencing the language without words … the universal language . The Englishman asked if they were in danger . including the danger . ” And he concluded by saying the mysterious word : “ Maktub . ” Englishman . “ Books are like caravans in that respect . ” The immense collection of people and animals began to travel when the travelers were accustomed to talking around the fires — attract attention to the caravan . The travelers adopted the practice of arranging the animals in a the nocturnal cold . And the leader posted armed sentinels at the fringes of the group . The Englishman was unable to sleep one night . He called to the Englishman the story of his life . The Englishman was fascinated with the part about the progress achieved at the crystal shop after the boy began working there . World . It ’ s always a positive force . ” animal — or even just a simple thought . rarely recognize that it is working for us . But in the crystal shop you probably realized that even the glasses were collaborating in your success . ” The boy thought about that for a while as he looked at the moon and the bleached sands . “ I have watched the caravan as it crossed “ If either of us had joined this caravan based only on personal would have been much more difficult . ” They stood there looking at the moon . speaks to the soul of the desert . ” caravan . ” that seemed to repeat itself throughout all the books : all things are the manifestation of one thing only . In one of the books he learned that the most important text in inscribed on the surface of an emerald . might teach something to the boy . The book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists . They were men who had dedicated their entire lives to the purification of metals in their laboratories ; they believed World . This Soul of the World allowed them to understand anything things communicated . They called that discovery the Master Work — it was part liquid and part solid . “ Can ’ t you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language ? ” the boy asked . has to be followed exactly as it was followed by the masters . ” The boy learned that the liquid part of the Master Work was alchemist from growing old . And the solid part was called the Philosopher ’ s Stone . observing the fire that purified the metals . They spent so much time close to the fire that gradually they gave up the vanities of the world . They discovered that the purification of the metals had led to a purification of themselves . ” The boy thought about the crystal merchant . He had said that it could free himself from negative thoughts . The boy was becoming more and more convinced that alchemy could be learned in one ’ s daily life . fascinating property . A small sliver of the stone can transform large quantities of metal into gold . ” transform everything into gold . He read the lives of the various and Geber . They were fascinating stories : each of them lived out his Philosopher ’ s Stone and the Elixir of Life . But when the boy wanted to learn how to achieve the Master “ WHY DO THEY MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED ? ” HE asked the Englishman and missed his books . “ So that those who have the responsibility for understanding can transforming lead into gold . Gold would lose its value . middle of the desert . I ’ m seeking a true alchemist who will help me to decipher the codes . ” “ When were these books written ? ” the boy asked . “ Many centuries ago . ” argued . “ There was no way for everybody to know about alchemy . The Englishman didn ’ t answer him directly . He said that for the past few days he had been paying attention to how the caravan he had noticed was that talk of war was becoming more and more frequent . THEN ONE DAY THE BOY RETURNED THE BOOKS TO THE Englishman . “ Did might be . He needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war . understands that soul can also understand the language of things . I they could be written on the surface of an emerald . ” magic the strange and the laboratory equipment … none of this had made an impression on the boy . His He took back his books and packed them away again in their bags . and the sand raised by the animals . “ Everyone has his or her own THE CARAVAN BEGAN TO TRAVEL DAY AND NIGHT . THE hooded Bedouins had become a good friend of the boy ’ s — explained that the war between the tribes had already begun . The caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis . themselves less and less . The silence was the worst aspect of the because it might signal a raid . the threat of war . “ Because I don ’ t live in either my past or my future . I ’ m interested only in the present . If you can concentrate always on the looked for the star they followed every night . He thought that the stars on the desert itself . “ Because we have to sleep . ” early . But the boy was quiet . He was at home with the silence of the would just be a memory . But this was the present moment — the party the camel driver had mentioned — and he wanted to live it as he did the lessons of his past and his dreams of the future . Although could herald a miracle . as he watched the hundreds of people and animals arriving at the excitement at the arrival of the strangers . The alchemist saw the at length . But none of that mattered to the alchemist . He had already seen had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands . The dunes sands he had known since he was a child . He always enjoyed seeing Maybe God created the desert so that man could appreciate the date He decided to concentrate on more practical matters . He knew that in the caravan there was a man to whom he was to teach some of his secrets . The omens had told him so . He didn ’ t know the man He hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice . I don ’ t know why these things have to be transmitted by word of revealed his secrets easily to all his creatures . He had only one explanation for this fact : things have to be and this kind of life cannot be captured in pictures or words . wind up forgetting the Language of the World . being just a well surrounded by a few palm trees — as he had seen once in a geography book — was much larger than many towns back and innumerable colored tents spread among them . impatient to meet with the alchemist . animals and people that were arriving . The men of the oasis wanted with one another for access to the cloth and precious stones brought by the merchants . The silence of the desert was a distant world and found themselves once again in the world of people . They were relieved and happy . camel driver explained to the boy that oases were always inhabitants were women and children . There were oases leaving the oases as places of refuge . people together and gave them his instructions . The group was to remain there at the oasis until the conflict between the tribes was accommodations . That was the law of hospitality . Then he asked the men appointed by the tribal chieftains . may not shelter armies or troops . ” revolver out of his bag and gave it to the men who were collecting the arms . “ Why a revolver ? ” he asked . seemed as if what the old king had called “ beginner ’ s luck ” were no constantly subjected to tests of his persistence and courage . So he he would fail to see the signs and omens left by God along his path . God placed them along my path . He had surprised himself with job . He had never thought of them in terms of a language used by God to indicate what he should do . driver said : ‘ Eat when it ’ s time to eat . And move along when it ’ s time to move along . ’ ” tent with five other young men of about his age . They were people tell them of his experiences at the crystal shop when the Englishman came into the tent . outside . “ I need you to help me find out where the alchemist lives . ” probably live in a manner that was different from that of the rest of the oasis was much larger than they could have imagined ; there were hundreds of tents . sitting down with the boy near one of the wells . The Englishman didn ’ t want to tell others about his reasons for The boy approached a woman who had come to the well to fill a goatskin with water . alchemist lives here at the oasis . ” because they were married women . He should respect tradition . The Englishman was disappointed . It seemed he had made the long journey for nothing . The boy was also saddened ; his friend was that ’ s what the old king had said . He couldn ’ t have been wrong . The Englishman ’ s eyes lit up . “ That ’ s it ! Maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is ! Find out who it is who cures the people ’ s illnesses ! ” insistence . Then a man approached . “ Do you know someone here who cures people ’ s illnesses ? ” the boy asked . strangers . “ You ’ re looking for witch doctors . ” He spoke some verses bucket . The boy repeated his question . “ Why do you want to find that sort of person ? ” the Arab asked . “ Because my friend here has traveled for many months in order the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to . Only when he consents . “ Wait for the end of the war . Then leave with the caravan . Don ’ t But the Englishman was exultant . They were on the right track . ask about the alchemist . Soul of the World surged within him . When he looked into her dark he learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke — the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart . It was love . Something older than crystals and in the silence of the desert . It was the pure Language of the World . It required no endless time . What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in than of anything in the world . He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person before becoming committed . But maybe people who felt that way under the sun has been written by one hand only . It is the hand that the same . “ What ’ s your name ? ” he asked . “ That ’ s what some women in my country are called . ” invaders carried the name everywhere . ” The beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride . man who cured people ’ s illnesses . said . “ He communicates with the genies of the desert . ” The genies were the spirits of good and evil . And the girl pointed she filled her vessel with water and left . day in Tarifa the levanter had brought to him the perfume of that she existed . He knew that his love for her would enable him to discover every treasure in the world . asked me if I had ever transformed lead into gold . I told him that was what I had come here to learn . “ He told me I should try to do so . That ’ s all he said : ‘ Go and try . ’ ” The boy didn ’ t say anything . The poor Englishman had traveled already done so many times . “ That ’ s what I ’ m going to do . I ’ m going to start now . ” water . my wife . I love you . ” “ I ’ m going to wait here for you every day . I have crossed the it brought me to you . ” The boy looked around him at the date palms . He reminded shepherd again . Fatima was more important than his treasure . if she had guessed what he was thinking . “ And the women of the desert are proud of their tribesmen . ” She refilled her vessel and left . The boy went to the well every day to meet with Fatima . He told of the caravan called a meeting of all of the people traveling with him . important to both armies . It ’ s not a battle of good against evil . It ’ s a Allah is on both sides . ” went to meet with Fatima that afternoon . He told her about the become a part of you . ” more beautiful than the sound of the wind in the date palms . “ I have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time . I which men of the desert expect women to behave . Ever since I was a The boy wanted to take her hand . But Fatima ’ s hands held to the handles of her jug . it . “ That ’ s why I want you to continue toward your goal . If you have our love for each other . come back one day . ” The boy was sad as he left her that day . He thought of all the married shepherds he had known . They had a difficult time convincing their wives that they had to go off into distant fields . Love required them to stay with the people they loved . hide in the ravines and of the water that comes from the earth . They become a part of everything … they become the Soul of the World . “ Some do come back . And then the other women are happy too will be one of the women who wait . The boy went to look for the Englishman . He wanted to tell him about Fatima . He was surprised when he saw that the Englishman they had when he was reading his books . was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the Master But I ’ m happy at least that I didn ’ t wait twenty years . ” desert turned pink in the setting sun . He felt the urge to go out into to become hypnotized by the horizon . He tried to deal with the He watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind . Although sense to the boy . It was just that he couldn ’ t grasp what it meant . He it . Maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership . everything in the world is beginning to make sense to me … even the materialized over the sands of the desert . But he certainly didn ’ t desire that an army invade the oasis . meditation . He tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the that wouldn ’ t allow him to do so . to occur . dangerous . observing the sunset . He saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes . answered . But the boy told him about the hawks : that he had been watching their flight and had suddenly felt himself to have plunged to the Soul of the World . The camel driver understood what the boy was saying . He knew that any given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history means of penetration to the Soul of the World . The desert was full of men who earned their living based on the ease with which they could penetrate to the Soul of the World . They would be impossible to be effective in battle if one knew that he was thrill of not knowing what the outcome would be ; the future was of many things : Where was the enemy ’ s sword ? Where was his horse ? What kind of blow should one deliver next in order to consulted with seers . Many of them had been right about what they had ever sought out ( and the one most to be feared ) had asked why the camel driver was so interested in the future . change those things that I don ’ t want to happen . ” said . myself for what ’ s coming . ” greatly before they even occur . ” driver had said to the seer . “ And men always live their lives based on the future . ” The seer was a specialist in the casting of twigs ; he threw them cloth and put them back in his bag . omens that are here in the present . guess at the future ? Based on the omens of the present . The secret is The camel driver had asked what the circumstances were under which God would allow him to see the future . that was written so as to be altered . ” thought . Why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument ? “ Tell them about the armies that are approaching . ” “ They ’ ll laugh at me . ” to dealing with omens . ” “ They ’ re not concerned with that right now . They believe that if someone will tell them about it . It has happened many times before . The boy thought of Fatima . And he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes . THE BOY APPROACHED THE GUARD AT THE FRONT OF THE huge white tent at the center of the oasis . “ I want to see the chieftains . I ’ ve brought omens from the desert . ” into the tent . conversation with her . boy was astonished by what he saw inside . Never could he have like this one . The ground was covered with the most beautiful resting upon richly embroidered silk cushions . Servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea . Other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs . The atmosphere was suffused with the sweet scent of smoke . which of them was the most important : an Arab dressed in white young Arab the boy had spoken with earlier . “ Who is this stranger who speaks of omens ? ” asked one of the knows that we have been here for generations ? ” said another of the chieftains . said . “ I can see things that eyes habituated to the desert might not see . ” to himself . third chieftain . you don ’ t have to do anything about it . ” The men fell into an animated discussion . They spoke in an told him that something was wrong . He regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert . and the boy felt better . The man hadn ’ t participated in the feel the vibrations of peace throughout the tent . Now his intuition was that he had been right in coming . The discussion ended . The chieftains were silent for a few moments as they listened to what the old man was saying . Then he turned to the boy : this time his expression was cold and distant . know that whoever believes in dreams also knows how to interpret them . ” “ We always observe the Tradition . The Tradition saved Egypt how their children should marry . The Tradition says that an oasis is vulnerable . ” No one said a word as the old man continued . “ But the Tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert . Everything we know was taught to us by the desert . ” again : no one at the oasis may carry arms . Throughout the entire day we will once again surrender their arms to me . For every ten dead men “ But arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle . Arms time they might not function . If at least one of them hasn ’ t been began to make his way there . He was alarmed by what had happened . He had succeeded in having done so might be his life . It was a frightening bet . But he had been making risky bets ever since the day he had sold his sheep to die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day . Every day was there to be lived or to mark one ’ s departure from this world . Everything depended on one word : “ Maktub . ” silence of the desert and Fatima ’ s eyes . He had lived every one of his days intensely since he had left home so long ago . If he died and he was proud of that . the ground by a wind such as he had never known . The area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view . Before frightening scream . what he saw . Astride the animal was a horseman dressed with a black kerchief . He appeared to be a messenger from the mere messenger . scabbard mounted on his saddle . The steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon . “ Who dares to read the meaning of the flight of the hawks ? ” he fifty thousand palm trees of Al-Fayoum . except that now the roles were reversed . I was able to see through to the Soul of the World . ” until the point touched the boy ’ s forehead . It drew a droplet of blood . sense of joy : he was about to die in pursuit of his Personal Legend . that Soul . The stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy ’ s forehead . “ Why did you read the flight of the birds ? ” “ I read only what the birds wanted to tell me . They wanted to men at the oasis than you have . ” The sword remained where it was . “ Who are you to change what Allah has willed ? ” taught me the language of the birds . Everything has been written by words . the boy felt immensely relieved . But he still couldn ’ t flee . of the battle . ” The stranger seemed satisfied with the answer . But he kept the sword in his hand . “ What is a stranger doing in a strange land ? ” “ I am following my Personal Legend . It ’ s not something you would understand . ” relaxed . quality most essential to understanding the Language of the World . ” The boy was surprised . The stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about . those who become distracted . ” What he said reminded the boy of the old king . The same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip . away . The hand with the whip pointed to the south . The boy had met the alchemist . throughout the palm trees at Al-Fayoum . Before the sun had horizon . The mounted troops entered the oasis from the north ; it hidden in their robes . When they reached the white tent at the they attacked an empty tent . The men of the oasis surrounded the horsemen from the desert and within half an hour all but one of the intruders were dead . The and saw nothing of what had happened . The women had remained The only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion . asked him why he had violated the Tradition . The commander said return to the war . that the Tradition was sacred . He condemned the commander to desert wind . asked the boy to become the counselor of the oasis . and a group of Arabs passing by told the boy that it was a place inhabited by genies . But the boy sat down and waited . Not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view . He carried two dead hawks over his shoulder . Personal Legend that brings you here ? ” desert . So I have come here . ” boy should enter the tent with him . It was a tent like many at the oasis . The boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus mysterious designs . said the alchemist . The boy suspected that they were the same hawks he had seen scent of the hookahs . “ Why did you want to see me ? ” the boy asked . Englishman . He ’ s the one that ’ s looking for you . ” “ He has other things to do first . But he ’ s on the right track . He has begun to try to understand the desert . ” “ And what about me ? ” Another person was there to help him toward his Personal Legend . “ So you are going to instruct me ? ” “ No . You already know all you need to know . I am only going to point you in the direction of your treasure . ” “ I know what ’ s happening in the desert . ” “ I also have Fatima . She is a treasure greater than anything else I have won . ” They ate in silence . The alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy ’ s cup . It was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted . “ Isn ’ t wine prohibited here ? ” the boy asked alchemist . “ It ’ s what comes out of their mouths that is . ” under a moon so brilliant that it made the stars pale . everything you have learned along the way can make sense . traitorous : they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire . they are about to die . ” where there is life out in the desert . Only those who can see such signs of life are able to find treasure . ” thought . I don ’ t know the desert that well yet . man . They reached the rocky place where the boy had seen the And then the boy understood . He loosened the reins on his followed as the boy ’ s horse ran for almost half an hour . They could no longer see the palms of the oasis — only the gigantic moon above alchemist ’ s eyes — the boy could see only his eyes — squinted with his effort . His arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the minutes . with the snakes of the desert . The boy watched as his companion went to his horse and then he placed the snake within it . The serpent relaxed immediately . “ Why was that so important ? ” “ Because the Pyramids are surrounded by the desert . ” The boy didn ’ t want to talk about the Pyramids . His heart was continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon Fatima . treasure . ” knows that men have to go away in order to return . And she already has her treasure : it ’ s you . Now she expects that you will find what it is you ’ re looking for . ” “ Let me tell you what will happen . You ’ ll be the counselor of the oasis . You have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels . how the world is always changing . And you ’ ll get better and better there is . try to ignore them . You ’ ll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants . The tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do . And your camels will bring you wealth and power . she ’ ll return your love . You ’ ll remember that she never asked you to man . So you won ’ t blame her . But many times you ’ ll walk the sands could have trusted more in your love for Fatima . Because what kept you at the oasis was your own fear that you might never come back . forever . and a great deal of merchandise . You ’ ll spend the rest of your days it ’ s too late . “ You must understand that love never keeps a man from because it wasn ’ t true love … the love that speaks the Language of the World . ” slithered away among the rocks . The boy remembered the crystal Englishman in search of the alchemist . He thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert . And he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved . followed the alchemist back to the oasis . The wind brought the strange horseman with the falcon on his shoulder had spoken of Legend . in his heart . response . friend enough gold to buy a sheep . Then he asked his friend to go into the tent where Fatima was buy yet another sheep . sheep . Fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent . The two walked out among the palms . The boy knew that it was a violation of the coming back . I love you because … ” one is loved . No reason is needed for loving . ” the entire universe conspired to help me find you . ” The two embraced . It was the first time either had touched the other . then . ” They said nothing else . They walked a bit farther among the said . He saw that Fatima ’ s eyes were filled with tears . “ You ’ re crying ? ” out to do the chores she had done for years . But everything had never again have the same meaning it had had only yesterday . It would no longer be a place with fifty thousand palm trees and three place for her . boy was following in search of his treasure . She would have to send the hope for his return . the boy as they began to ride across the sands of the desert . forever . ” boy said . He was already reaccustomed to the desert ’ s silence . one can always come back . If what you had found was only a on your return . ” The man was speaking the language of alchemy . But the boy knew that he was referring to Fatima . It was difficult not to think about what he had left behind . The camel driver who was a teacher without realizing it . Maybe the speaking only of the precautions they needed to follow in order to failed to observe . offered his water container to the boy . “ I congratulate you for having pursued your Personal Legend . ” thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know . A alchemy . But I wasn ’ t able to learn anything from them . ” through action . Everything you need to know you have learned through your journey . You need to learn only one thing more . ” “ Why are you called the alchemist ? ” “ Because that ’ s what I am . ” “ And what went wrong when other alchemists tried to make gold and were unable to do so ? ” wanting actually to live out the Personal Legend . ” “ What is it that I still need to know ? ” the boy asked . But the alchemist continued to look to the horizon . And finally the falcon returned with their meal . They dug a hole and lit their fire feel that they knew a better way than others had . Yet the Emerald Tablet is still alive today . ” “ What was written on the Emerald Tablet ? ” the boy wanted to know . as if it had taken place years and years ago . The boy tried to read what was written in the sand . saw in the Englishman ’ s books . ” hawks ; it can ’ t be understood by reason alone . The Emerald Tablet is a direct passage to the Soul of the World . “ The wise men understood that this natural world is only an image and a copy of paradise . The existence of this world is simply a guarantee that there exists a world that is perfect . God created the spiritual teachings and the marvels of his wisdom . That ’ s what I mean by action . ” “ Should I understand the Emerald Tablet ? ” the boy asked . the right time to study the best way to understand the Emerald Tablet . But you are in the desert . So immerse yourself in it . The on the face of the earth will do that . You don ’ t even have to understand the desert : all you have to do is contemplate a simple “ How do I immerse myself in the desert ? ” THEY CROSSED THE DESERT FOR ANOTHER TWO DAYS IN silence . The approaching the area where the most violent battles were being times it became so emotional over the desert sunrise that the boy had to hide his tears . His heart beat fastest when it spoke to the boy when the boy and the alchemist had fallen into silence . they had made camp that day . treasure . ” when I ’ m thinking about her . ” has to say . ” boy ’ s heart began to speak of fear . It told him stories it had heard treasure and never succeeded . Sometimes it frightened the boy with satisfied : it had found love and riches . had paused to rest the horses . “ It doesn ’ t want me to go on . ” you ’ ve won . ” “ Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet . Even if and about the world . ” “ Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly . If you know your “ You will never be able to escape from your heart . So it ’ s better unanticipated blow . ” The boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the suffer terribly . ” alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky . “ Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself . And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in second ’ s encounter with God and with eternity . ” was a part of the dream that I would find it . When I have been truly I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that seemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve . ” things that came from the Soul of the World . It said that all people who are happy have God within them . And that happiness could be has taken millions of years to create it . “ Everyone on earth has a want to go in search of them . We speak of them only to children . we don ’ t want people to suffer because they don ’ t follow their hearts . ” “ Why don ’ t people ’ s hearts tell them to continue to follow their dreams ? ” the boy asked the alchemist . like to suffer . ” message . understood that the boy ’ s heart had returned to the Soul of the World . “ So what should I do now ? ” the boy asked . “ And continue to pay heed to the omens . Your heart is still capable of showing you where the treasure is . ” “ Is that the one thing I still needed to know ? ” everything that was learned along the way . It does this not because master the lessons we ’ ve learned as we ’ ve moved toward that dream . That ’ s the point at which most people give up . It ’ s the point just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon . ’ “ Every search begins with beginner ’ s luck . And every search ends with the victor ’ s being severely tested . ” The boy remembered an old proverb from his country . It said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn . the alchemist were doing there . “ We ’ re going to have to search you to see whether you ’ re had searched the boy ’ s bag . The tribesman who was searching the alchemist ’ s belongings that was slightly larger than a chicken ’ s egg . “ What are these things ? ” he asked . “ That ’ s the Philosopher ’ s Stone and the Elixir of Life . It ’ s the Master Work of the alchemists . Whoever swallows that elixir will into gold . ” alchemist to proceed with all of their belongings . moved on . “ What did you do that for ? ” the boy ’ s heart became more and more silent . It no longer wanted to know about things of the past or future ; it was content simply to was capable now of betraying the other . the desert were wearisome . His heart told the boy what his strongest qualities were : his courage in having given up his sheep during the time he had worked at the crystal shop . And his heart told him something else that the boy had never he had never perceived . His heart said that one time it had hidden that the boy might wound himself . And it reminded the boy of the he had fallen into a deep sleep . There had been two thieves farther ahead who were planning to steal the boy ’ s sheep and murder him . thinking that he had changed his route . “ Does a man ’ s heart always help him ? ” the boy asked the alchemist . “ Mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their “ Does that mean that I ’ ll never run into danger ? ” said . tribes . At each corner of the camp were Arabs garbed in beautiful hookahs and trading stories from the battlefield . No one paid any attention to the two travelers . the encampment . forget that you ’ re in the desert . When men are at war with one one fails to suffer the consequences of everything under the sun . ” appeared from behind the travelers . where the tribes are at war . ” straight into the eyes of the horsemen . They were silent for a move along . The boy watched the exchange with fascination . “ You dominated alchemist . been one who stared fixedly at the two . He had been so far away that his face wasn ’ t even visible . But the boy was certain that he had been looking at them . only two days from the Pyramids . teach me about alchemy . ” “ You already know about alchemy . It is about penetrating to the reserved for you . ” into gold . ” only after they had stopped to eat . don ’ t know why . I just know that the Tradition is always right . conflict . ” But then he stopped . The alchemist probably already knew all that . thing evolves as well . “ Others stumbled upon the stone by accident . They already had of others . But they don ’ t count . They ’ re quite rare . iron have their own Personal Legends to fulfill . And anyone who interferes with the Personal Legend of another thing never will discover his own . ” The alchemist ’ s words echoed out like a curse . He reached over and picked up a shell from the ground . The alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear . He had of the sea . Legend . And it will never cease doing so until the desert is once again covered by water . ” Pyramids of Egypt . THE SUN WAS SETTING WHEN THE BOY ’ S HEART SOUNDED a danger signal . alchemist to see whether he had sensed anything . But he appeared horsemen waiting ahead of them . Before he could say anything to hundred . And then they were everywhere in the dunes . surrounding their turbans . Their faces were hidden behind blue souls . And their eyes spoke of death . THE TWO WERE TAKEN TO A NEARBY MILITARY CAMP . A soldier shoved the boy and the alchemist into a tent where the chief was holding a meeting with his staff . “ You were seen at the enemy camp three days ago . And you were talking with one of the troops there . ” said the alchemist . “ I have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes . I was simply acting as a guide for my friend here . ” “ Who is your friend ? ” the chief asked . nature . And he wants to show you his extraordinary powers . ” The boy listened quietly . And fearfully . “ What is a foreigner doing here ? ” asked another of the men . alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief . The Arab accepted them without a word . There was enough there to buy a lot of weapons . “ It ’ s a man who understands nature and the world . If he wanted knew that the wind could not deliver them a fatal blow . Yet each felt were fearful of sorcerers . tribe . ” of the tent . But the boy couldn ’ t even speak . He was able to do so only after they had walked through the center of the camp . There was no need an impenetrable wall . “ You gave them everything I had ! ” the boy said . “ Everything I ’ ve saved in my entire life ! ” alchemist answered . “ Your money saved us for three days . It ’ s not often that money saves a person ’ s life . ” But the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom . He had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind . He wasn ’ t an alchemist ! alchemist muttered some words that the boy didn ’ t understand . “ But I have no idea how to turn myself into the wind . ” everything he needs to know . There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve : the fear of failure . ” “ I ’ m not afraid of failing . It ’ s just that I don ’ t know how to turn myself into the wind . ” “ But what if I can ’ t ? ” “ Then you ’ ll die in the midst of trying to realize your Personal who never even knew what their Personal Legends were . of death makes people a lot more aware of their lives . ” number of wounded were brought back to the camp . The dead of his companions . “ You could have died after peace had been who had taken his falcon out into the desert . repeated . “ Remember what I told you : the world is only the visible aspect of God . And that what alchemy does is to bring spiritual perfection into contact with the material plane . ” “ What are you doing ? ” “ Feeding my falcon . ” the boy said . “ Why feed your falcon ? ” know how to turn myself into the wind . ” camp . The sentinels allowed him to go ; they had already heard He spent the entire afternoon of the second day looking out over sensed his fear . They both spoke the same language . himself into the wind . ” The boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day . He told them all to be seated . desert . ” The boy looked out at the horizon . There were mountains in the living where survival seemed impossible . There was the desert that palm trees and three hundred wells . “ What do you want here today ? ” the desert asked him . “ Didn ’ t you spend enough time looking at me yesterday ? ” the wind . ” “ What is love ? ” the desert asked . generous to him . ” answered . “ To nourish the falcon . And the falcon then nourishes will once again flourish . That ’ s how the world goes . ” “ So is that what love is ? ” “ But you can at least understand that somewhere in your sands there is a woman waiting for me . And that ’ s why I have to turn myself into the wind . ” The desert didn ’ t answer him for a few moments . wind . ” A breeze began to blow . The tribesmen watched the boy from a couldn ’ t understand . The alchemist smiled . The wind approached the boy and touched his face . It knew of to die . loved one to me . ” “ Who taught you to speak the language of the desert and the wind ? ” things . ” I love . ” “ I heard what you were talking about the other day with the Personal Legend . But people can ’ t turn themselves into the wind . ” “ So you and I can talk about the limitless possibilities of people and the winds . ” know how to turn a man into the wind . And look how many things that there were other things the wind should be able to do . wind . And it knew nothing about love . having to acknowledge its own limitations . “ Maybe it ’ s better to ask heaven . ” sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun . Then I can look to heaven without blinding myself . ” sand . The sun was turned into a golden disk . desert were already familiar with that wind . They called it the and all their weapons were filled with sand . They could barely see the boy . Their faces were covered with the “ I want to see how a man turns himself into the wind . ” But he made a mental note of the names of the two men who had are not afraid . grow and the sheep to seek out shade . From where I am — and I ’ m a long way from the earth — I learned how to love . I know that if I and the Soul of the World would no longer exist . So we contemplate and it gives me my reason for living . ” great length to each other during this endless trip through the only the minerals and vegetables understand that all things are one . the same as gold . Each performs its own exact function as a unique that wrote all this had stopped on the fifth day of creation . the boy said . “ But you don ’ t know about love . If there hadn ’ t been a but one day that Personal Legend will be realized . So each thing has thing only . ” was in his former life . Lead will play its role until the world has no further need for lead ; and then lead will have to turn itself into gold . too . ” asked the boy . roam the world like the wind . And it ’ s not love to see everything become better or worse . And that ’ s where the power of love comes we are . ” “ So what do you want of me ? ” the sun asked . answered . “ But I don ’ t know how to turn you into the wind . ” and wanted to tell every corner of the world that the sun ’ s wisdom had its limitations . That it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the Language of the World . each other as they sought to keep from being blown away . speak . prayer without words or pleas . His prayer didn ’ t give thanks for his sheep having found new pastures ; it didn ’ t ask that the boy be able to sell more crystal ; and it didn ’ t beseech that the woman he had single emerald . He saw that omens were scattered throughout the man into the wind . Because only the hand understood that it was a larger design that had moved the universe to the point at which six days of creation had evolved into a Master Work . it was a part of the Soul of God . And he saw that the Soul of God was THE SIMUM BLEW THAT DAY AS IT HAD NEVER BLOWN before . For where the boy had been . But he was no longer there ; he was camp . The men were terrified at his sorcery . But there were two the glory of God . them as far as they chose . the escorts they could return to the camp . only three hours from the Pyramids . ” World . ” “ I only invoked what you already knew . ” The alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery . A monk dressed in black came to the gates . They spoke for a few minutes in smiled . They went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery . The which the alchemist placed in an iron pan . When the lead had and added it to the pan in which the lead had melted . The monk was irritated . The caravans had been stopped at Giza the monk said . longer lead . It was gold . “ Will I learn to do that someday ? ” the boy asked . answered . “ But I wanted to show you that it was possible . ” alchemist separated the disk into four parts . monk . “ It ’ s for your generosity to the pilgrims . ” responded . the next time . ” The alchemist turned to the boy . “ This is for you . To make up for what you gave to the general . ” The boy was about to say that it was much more than he had alchemist said to the monk . He took the fourth part and handed it to the monk . “ This is for the boy . If he ever needs it . ” close to it now . ” “ Then why this ? ” “ Because you have already lost your savings twice . Once to the happens once can never happen again . But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time . ’ ” They mounted their horses . The boy brought his horse closer . sent to the most distant regions of the empire . The other son was a and told him that the words of one of his sons would be learned and repeated throughout the world for all generations to come . The proud to know . who was about to be crushed by the wheels of a chariot . Since he in his dream . any wish you desire . ’ son ’ s poems will be read by men for generations to come .

But the centurion was he was surely in the presence of the Son of God . ’ under my roof . But only speak a word and my servant will be healed . ” ” ’ earth plays a central role in the history of the world . And normally he doesn ’ t know it . ” The boy smiled . He had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd . avidly to what his heart had to say . It was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden . alchemist had told him . story of a shepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had many men who had wandered in search of distant lands or beautiful change . “ Be aware of the place where you are brought to tears . That ’ s where The boy climbed the dune slowly . A full moon rose again in the starry sky : it had been a month since he had set forth from the oasis . appearance of a rolling sea ; it reminded the boy of the day when journey in search of treasure . illuminated by the light of the moon and the brightness of the The boy fell to his knees and wept . He thanked God for making for his having met a woman of the desert who had told him that love would never keep a man from his Personal Legend . He didn ’ t need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone . The everything he might have dreamed of . reminded himself that no project is completed until its objective has he thought of what the crystal merchant had once said : that anyone could build a pyramid in his backyard . The boy could see now that he couldn ’ t do so if he placed stone upon stone for the rest of his life . but found nothing . He felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the Pyramids had been built . But he didn ’ t stop . He struggled sand back into the excavation . His hands were abraded and his tears fell . heard footsteps . Several figures approached him . Their backs were faces . “ What are you doing here ? ” one of the figures demanded . other figure said . “ What are you hiding there ? ” But one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the gold . in the man ’ s eyes the boy saw death . “ He ’ s probably got more gold hidden in the ground . ” near . “ What good is money to you if you ’ re going to die ? It ’ s not often that he had twice dreamed of a treasure hidden near the Pyramids of Egypt . The man who appeared to be the leader of the group spoke to one of the others : “ Leave him . He doesn ’ t have anything else . He must have stolen this gold . ” look for a ruined church where shepherds and their sheep slept . In would find a hidden treasure . But I ’ m not so stupid as to cross an entire desert just because of a recurrent dream . ” And they disappeared . heart bursting with joy . Because now he knew where his treasure was . EPILOGUE could still be seen through the half-destroyed roof . He remembered the time he had been there with his sheep ; it had been a peaceful night … except for the dream . He sat looking at the sky for a long time . Then he took from his looked at the stars and drank wine together . He thought of the many show him his treasure . If he hadn ’ t believed in the significance of himself . began to dig at the base of the sycamore . whole story . You even left a bit of gold at the monastery so I could get back to this church . The monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters . Couldn ’ t you have saved me from that ? ” with jewels . The spoils of a conquest that the country had long ago about . The boy took out Urim and Thummim from his bag . He had used marketplace . His life and his path had always provided him with enough omens . He placed Urim and Thummim in the chest . They were also a It ’ s true ; life really is generous to those who pursue their to get to Tarifa so he could give one-tenth of his treasure to the he thought .

INTERNATIONAL ACCLAIM BOOKS BY PAULO COELHO CREDITS COVER COPYRIGHT ABOUT THE PUBLISHER TEN YEARS ON I REMEMBER RECEIVING A LETTER FROM THE AMERICAN publisher Harper Collins that said that  “ reading The Alchemist was like getting up at dawn and seeing the sun rise while the rest of the world still slept  ” I struggling to establish myself as a writer and to follow my path despite all the voices telling me it was impossible  Brazilian journalist phoned to say that President Clinton had been Roberts declaring that she adored the book  Walking alone down a The Alchemist  ” What ’ s the secret behind such a huge success  that God chose for you here on Earth  Whenever we do something we don ’ t all have the courage to confront our own dream  Why  There are four obstacles  First  we are told from childhood onward that everything we want to do is impossible  We grow up calling is so deeply buried in our soul as to be invisible  But it ’ s still there  afraid of hurting those around us by abandoning everything in order to pursue our dream  We do not realize that love is just a We do not realize that those who genuinely wish us well want us to be happy and are prepared to accompany us on that journey  against the third obstacle  fear of the defeats we will meet on the didn ’ t really want it anyway  ” We do want it and know that we have staked everything on it and that the path of the personal calling is patience in difficult times and to know that the Universe is I ask myself  are defeats necessary  up eight times  only going to suffer more than other people  do — we are filled by a greater sense of euphoria and confidence  In unexpected suffering passes more quickly than suffering that is to free ourselves from the bitterness and it stays with us for the rest of our lives  the very next day  Then comes the fourth obstacle  the fear of realizing the dream for which we fought all our lives  Oscar Wilde said  “ Each man kills the thing he loves  ” And it ’ s true  The mere possibility of getting what we want fills the soul of the ordinary person with guilt  We look around at all those who have failed to get what they want and feel that we do not deserve to get what we want either  We forget about all the obstacles we series of stupid mistakes and never reached their goal — when it was only a step away  This is the most dangerous of the obstacles because it has a kind of saintly aura about it  renouncing joy and conquest  But if you and you understand why you are here  Paulo Coelho Rio de Janeiro November 2002 Translated by Margaret Jull Costa PROLOGUE Translated by Clifford E  Landers THE ALCHEMIST PICKED UP A BOOK THAT SOMEONE IN THE caravan had Narcissus  daily beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty  He was so called the narcissus  But this was not how the author of the book ended the story  transformed into a lake of salty tears  “ Why do you weep  ” the goddesses asked  contemplate his beauty close at hand  ” “ But … was Narcissus beautiful  ” the lake asked  “ Who better than you to know that  ” the goddesses said in contemplate himself  ” PART ONE THE BOY ’ S NAME WAS SANTIAGO  DUSK WAS FALLING AS the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church  The roof had fallen in long sacristy had once stood  He decided to spend the night there  He saw to it that all the across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night  searching for it  he had just finished reading as a pillow  He told himself that he made more comfortable pillows  the stars through the halfdestroyed roof  before it ended  animals also began to stir  It was as if some mysterious energy could be the other way around  that it was he who had become accustomed to their schedule  But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken  name  He had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said  So there were times when he read them would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in the fields  Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed  But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one they would reach in about four days  He had been to the village only until the afternoon  So the boy sat on the steps of the shop and took a book from his bag  behind him  each day was like all the others  The shepherd told her of the where he had stopped  It was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep  “ How did you learn to read  ” the girl asked at one point  The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question  He was sure the girl would never days  He recognized that he was feeling something he had never experienced before  the desire to live in one place forever  With the four sheep  He paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year  AND NOW IT WAS ONLY FOUR DAYS BEFORE HE WOULD BE back in that same selling their wool  other places  ” But in his heart he knew that it did matter  And he knew that town where there was someone who could make them forget the joys of carefree wandering  thought  Maybe that ’ s why they always stay close to me  The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water  seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk  and they had the boy told them about the sights of the cities  They were content nourishment  him to feel anger toward his faithful companions  He drank a bit and he gathered his jacket closer to his body  He knew that a few great that he would not be able to lead his flock across the fields  It was the time of day when all of Spain slept during the summer  The jacket  But when he thought to complain about the burden of its withstood the cold of the dawn  grateful for the jacket ’ s weight and warmth  explain to the girl how it was that a simple shepherd knew how to read  That he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen  His pride for a simple farm family  They worked hard just to have food didn ’ t want to become a priest  That he wanted to travel  they leave they are basically the same people they were when they thinking that the past was better than what we have now  They have who live right here  ” boy explained  son  who travel are the shepherds  ” that held three ancient Spanish gold coins  “ I found these one day in the fields  I wanted them to be a part of women are the most beautiful  ” And he gave the boy his blessing  The boy could see in his happy  he had already seen many castles and met many women  but none the equal of the one who awaited him several days hence   He through those parts many times  The world was huge and inexhaustible  he had only to allow his sheep to set the route for a is that they don ’ t even realize that they ’ re walking a new road every day  They don ’ t see that the fields are new and the seasons change  All they think about is food and water  thought of other women since I met the merchant ’ s daughter  had arrived there before him and asked for her hand  It ’ s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life there was an old woman who interpreted dreams  THE OLD WOMAN LED THE BOY TO A ROOM AT THE BACK of her house  it was separated from her living room by a curtain of colored beads  The It sounded like a Gypsy prayer  The boy had already had had no flocks of sheep  People said that Gypsies spent their lives always been frightened to death that he would be captured by his hands in hers  showing the old woman that he was fearful  He recited an Our Father silently  the woman sensed it  He quickly pulled his hands away  regretting having come  He thought for a moment that it would be giving too much importance to his recurrent dream  old woman  “ And dreams are the language of God  When he speaks and that ’ s what makes a shepherd ’ s life exciting  sheep are afraid of strangers  But children always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them  I don ’ t know why  I don ’ t know how animals know the age of human beings  ” give you a lot of time  ” both hands and transported me to the Egyptian pyramids  ” He paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the Egyptian pyramids were  But she said nothing  times  ” The woman was silent for some time  Then she again took his hands and studied them carefully  The boy laughed — out of happiness  He was going to be able to save the little money he had because of a dream about hidden treasure  your treasure in exchange for what I am going to tell you  ” The shepherd swore that he would  The old woman asked him to swear again while looking at the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus  that I deserve a part of what you find  “ And this is my interpretation  you must go to the Pyramids in you a rich man  ” out the old woman for this  But then he remembered that he wasn ’ t going to have to pay anything  “ I told you that your dream was a difficult one  It ’ s the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary  only wise men are “ I only interpret dreams  I don ’ t know how to turn them into reality  That ’ s why I have to live off what my daughters provide me with  ” “ And what if I never get to Egypt  ” “ Then I don ’ t get paid  It wouldn ’ t be the first time  ” wasted too much time with him  So the boy was disappointed  he decided that he would never again believe in dreams  He remembered that he had a number of things he had to take care of  he went to the market for something bench in the plaza where he could sample the new wine he had The boy knew a lot of people in the city  That was what made need to spend all of his time with them  When someone sees the they wind up becoming a part of that person ’ s life  And then they want the person to change  If someone isn ’ t what others want them her own  He decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky before following his flock back through the fields  Three days from He started to read the book he had bought  On the very first page it described a burial ceremony  And the names of the people reader wouldn ’ t have to worry about memorizing a lot of names  down at his side and tried to strike up a conversation  in the plaza  wanted to concentrate on his reading  who was capable of doing difficult things  He had already imagined he explained that the sheep had to be sheared from back to front  He also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared them as if they were from his personal experience  She would never hoping that the old man would leave him alone  ashamed and decide of his own accord to change benches  irritating  ” “ It ’ s a book that says the same thing almost all the other books in inability to choose their own Personal Legends  And it ends up saying that everyone believes the world ’ s greatest lie  ” surprised  That ’ s the world ’ s greatest lie  ” travel  ” want to return it at all  The boy noticed that the man ’ s clothing was parts  Africa was only a few hours from Tarifa  one had only to cross shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day  “ Where are you from  ” the boy asked  “ From many places  ” from a city near an ancient castle  That ’ s where I was born  ” fearing that he would appear ignorant  He looked at the people in seemed to be very busy  “ It ’ s like it always has been  ” No clue yet  But he knew that Salem wasn ’ t in Andalusia  If it “ And what do you do in Salem  ” he insisted  king of Salem  ” alone with one ’ s books  They tell their incredible stories at the time they say some things that are so strange that you don ’ t know how to continue the conversation  do you have  ” know more about his life  you ’ ve got enough sheep  ” The boy was getting irritated  He wasn ’ t asking for help  It was the conversation  sheep and get going  ” you how to find the hidden treasure  ” old man — maybe he was her husband — was going to find a way to get much more money in exchange for information about something Something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded  With a movement that was too read what the old man had written in the sand  names of his father and his mother and the name of the seminary he awed and embarrassed  “ For several reasons  But let ’ s say that the most important is that you have succeeded in discovering your Personal Legend  ” The boy didn ’ t know what a person ’ s “ Personal Legend ” was  impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend  ” None of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy  But he wanted to know what the “ mysterious force ” was  the merchant ’ s daughter would be impressed when he told her about that  how to realize your Personal Legend  It prepares your spirit and universe  It ’ s your mission on earth  ” “ Even when all you want to do is travel  Or marry the daughter of a textile merchant  ” and jealousy  To realize one ’ s Personal Legend is a person ’ s only real obligation  All things are one  helping you to achieve it  ” townspeople  It was the old man who spoke first  “ Why do you tend a flock of sheep  ” “ Because I like to travel  ” The old man pointed to a baker standing in his shop window at shepherds sleep out in the open  Parents would rather see their children marry bakers than shepherds  ” daughter  There was surely a baker in her town  about shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them than their own Personal Legends  ” as he himself had been interrupted  “ Why are you telling me all this  ” “ Because you are trying to realize your Personal Legend  And you are at the point where you ’ re about to give it all up  ” “ And that ’ s when you always appear on the scene  ” people don ’ t realize I ’ ve done them  ” had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds  For five years thousands of stones looking for an emerald  The miner was about to more stone — just one more — he would find his emerald  Since the decided to become involved  He transformed himself into a stone it aside  But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone beautiful emerald in the world  The boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure  flock  ” “ What about onetenth of my treasure  ” The old man looked disappointed  “ If you start out by promising toward getting it  ” The boy told him that he had already promised to give onetenth of his treasure to the Gypsy  life has its price  This is what the Warriors of the Light try to teach  ” The old man returned the book to the boy  And I will tell you how to find the hidden treasure  Good afternoon  ” And he vanished around the corner of the plaza  man was right  He went over to the bakery and bought a loaf of the old man had said about him  Sometimes it ’ s better to leave the way things were  The boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the baker  So he began to wander through the he knew that Egypt was in Africa  “ Can I help you  ” asked the man behind the window  strait  The idea frightened him  watching the boy walk away  “ He doesn ’ t have enough money to travel  ” years he had learned everything about shepherding  he knew how the sheep from wolves  He knew all the fields and pastures of Andalusia  And he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals  He decided to return to his friend ’ s stable by the longest route all of Spain  the plaza where he had talked with the old man  Curse the moment I a woman who could interpret his dream  Neither the woman nor the old man was at all impressed by the fact that he was a shepherd  and didn ’ t understand that shepherds become attached to their sheep  He knew everything about each member of his flock  he The wind began to pick up  He knew that wind  people called it the eastern end of the Mediterranean  something he had become accustomed to and something he wanted didn ’ t even remember him  He was sure that it made no difference recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises  to come and go from the baker ’ s shop  A young couple sat on the brought the smell of the desert and of veiled women  It had brought with it the sweat and the dreams of men who had once left to search that he could have the same freedom  There was nothing to hold the fields of Andalusia were only steps along the way to his Personal Legend  sheep with him  sheep immediately  He said that he had always dreamed of being a almost sure to win  Beginner ’ s luck  ” “ Why is that  ” “ Because there is a force that wants you to realize your Personal Legend  it whets your appetite with a taste of success  ” wool  “ Where is the treasure  ” he asked  The boy was startled  The old woman had said the same thing  But she hadn ’ t charged him anything  God has prepared a path for everyone to follow  You just have to read the omens that he left for you  ” between him and the old man  He remembered something his grandfather had once told him  that butterflies were a good omen  clovers  “ Just as your grandfather taught you  These are good omens  ” precious stones  The boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day  He really was a king  He must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves  black stone that had been embedded at the center of the breastplate  “ They are called Urim and Thummim  The black question  at the Pyramids  that you already knew  But I had to insist on the payment of six sheep because I helped you to make your decision  ” make his own decisions  “ Don ’ t forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and don ’ t forget to follow your Personal Legend through to its conclusion  “ A certain shopkeeper sent his son to learn about the secret of happiness from the wisest man in the world  The lad wandered of the most delicious food in that part of the world  The wise man before it was his turn to be given the man ’ s attention  “ The wise man listened attentively to the boy ’ s explanation of explain the secret of happiness  He suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in two hours  to spill  ’ “ The boy began climbing and descending the many stairways of returned to the room where the wise man was  that are hanging in my dining hall  Did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create  Did you notice the beautiful parchments in my library  ’ nothing  His only concern had been not to spill the oil that the wise man had entrusted to him  wise man  ‘ You cannot trust a man if you don ’ t know his house  ’ related in detail everything he had seen  “ ‘ But where are the drops of oil I entrusted to you  ’ asked the wise man  gone  wisest of wise men  ‘ The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels The shepherd said nothing  He had understood the story the old never forget about his sheep  much change  All they wanted was food and water  Melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out seen Abraham again after having charged him his onetenth fee  That was his work  Personal Legends  But the king of Salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful  thought  I should have repeated it for him  Then when he spoke sometimes has to take some pride in himself  ” He was sitting in a bar very much like the other bars he had seen along the narrow streets of Tangier  Some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other  In just a few chanted — as everyone about him went to their knees and placed their foreheads on the ground  had always looked at the image of Saint Santiago Matamoros on his kneeling at his feet  The boy felt ill and terribly alone  The infidels had an evil look about them  time  only Arabic was spoken in this country  drink that had been served at the next table  It turned out to be a bitter tea  The boy preferred wine  But he didn ’ t need to worry about that right now  What he had about getting it  The sale of his sheep had left him with enough man had known what he was talking about  during the time the boy which path he should take by observing the ground and the sky  He had discovered that the presence of a certain bird meant that a was water in the area  The sheep had taught him that  “ Who are you  ” he heard a voice ask him in Spanish  someone had appeared  “ How come you speak Spanish  ” he asked  The new arrival was a was from this city  He was about the same age and height as the boy  “ Almost everyone here speaks Spanish  We ’ re only two hours from Spain  ” ask for a glass of wine for me  I hate this tea  ” religion here forbids it  ” The boy told him then that he needed to get to the Pyramids  He payment for taking him there  He remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn ’ t even have yet  “ I ’ d like you to take me there if you can  I can pay you to serve as my guide  ” “ Do you have any idea how to get there  ” the newcomer asked  listening attentively to their conversation  He felt uneasy at the out on an opportunity  enough  ” The boy thought it a strange question  But he trusted in the old universe always conspires in your favor  He took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young irritated  leave  ” grabbed him and began to speak to him in an angry stream of has its thieves  ” The boy trusted his new friend  He had helped him out in a dangerous situation  He took out his money and counted it  taking the money  “ But I have to buy two camels  ” They walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier  Everywhere there were stalls with items for sale  They reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held  There were that would be unfriendly  He knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in  than his friend  most beautiful sword he had ever seen  The scabbard was embossed to his friend  Then he realized that he had been distracted for a few he knew what he would find  He continued to look at the beautiful around  could he find his new companion  The boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident  He decided to stay right there and nearby tower and began his chant  everyone in the market fell to stalls and left  houses surrounding the plaza  He recalled that when the sun had morning he had known everything that was going to happen to him where he couldn ’ t even speak the language  He was no longer a start everything over  could have changed so suddenly and so drastically  He was so ashamed that he wanted to cry  He had never even and because this was the way God repaid those who believed in their dreams  now I ’ m sad and alone  I ’ m going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me  I ’ m going to hate those who have found their treasure because I never found mine  And I ’ m conquer the world  He opened his pouch to see what was left of his possessions  maybe there was a bit left of the sandwich he had eaten on the ship  the old man had given him  had exchanged six sheep for two precious stones that had been taken from a gold breastplate  He could sell the stones and buy a removing them from the pouch so he could put them in his pocket  him was that port towns are full of thieves  Now he understood why the owner of the bar had been so upset  he was trying to tell him not to trust that man  “ I ’ m like everyone not what actually does  ” temperature and feeling their surfaces  They were his treasure  Just handling them made him feel better  They reminded him of the old man  The boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man stones were proof that he had met with a king — a king who knew of the boy ’ s past  read the omens  ” The boy put the stones back in the pouch and decided to do an experiment  The old man had said to ask very clear he asked if the old man ’ s blessing was still with him  He took out one of the stones  It was “ yes  ” “ Am I going to find my treasure  ” he asked  pouch and fell to the ground  The boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch  He knelt down to find Urim and Thummim and put them back in the pouch  But as he saw them lying said  An omen  The boy smiled to himself  He picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch  He didn ’ t consider mending the hole — the stones could fall through any time they wanted  He so as not to flee from one ’ s own Personal Legend  “ I promised that I and that made him feel more confident  He looked around at the strange place  it was a new one  thought  Although his new world at the moment was just an empty and he would never forget it  He remembered the sword  It hurt him between thinking of himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an adventurer in quest of his treasure  HE WAS SHAKEN INTO WAKEFULNESS BY SOMEONE  HE had fallen asleep in resume  He no longer had to seek out food and water for the sheep  he could as much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books  He walked slowly through the market  The merchants were reminded the boy of the old man — the mysterious old king he had met  “ This candy merchant isn ’ t making candy so that later he can travel or marry a shopkeeper ’ s daughter  He ’ s doing it because it ’ s the same thing the old man had done — sense whether a person was near to or far from his Personal Legend  Just by looking at them  It ’ s spoken Arabic and the other Spanish  And they had understood each other perfectly well  it ’ s happening with people  He was learning a lot of new things  Some of them were things had never perceived before  And he hadn ’ t perceived them because he had become accustomed to them  He realized  If I can learn to the world  the narrow streets of Tangier  Only in that way would he be able to his sheep  that he felt every morning  He had been in the same place for thirty years  a shop at the top of a hilly street where few customers passed  Now it was too late to change anything — the only thing he had ever learned to do was to buy and sell crystal glassware  There had been a time when many people knew of his shop  Arab were always wellheeled  In those days it had been wonderful to be have beautiful women at his side as he grew older  on the hill  And no one was going to climb the hill just to browse through a few small shops  But the crystal merchant had no choice  He had lived thirty years to do anything else  He spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings practiced eyes of the crystal merchant could see that the boy had no lunch for a few minutes until the boy moved on  A CARD HANGING IN THE DOORWAY ANNOUNCED THAT several languages were spoken in the shop  The boy saw a man appear behind the counter  them  ” The man looked at him without responding  entered the shop and bought some crystal  merchant  laughed  requires me to feed a hungry person  ” “ Because the crystal was dirty  And both you and I needed to cleanse our minds of negative thoughts  ” “ I ’ d like you to work in my shop  Two customers came in today really don ’ t know what they ’ re saying  Just as I hadn ’ t realized that for so many years I had been speaking a language without words to my sheep  “ Do you want to go to work for me  ” the merchant asked  The merchant laughed  “ Even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year … even if you earned a good commission selling every are thousands of kilometers of desert between here and there  ” There was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the Pyramids  It was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy ’ s that moment  The merchant looked anxiously at the boy  All the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared  picked up his pouch  some sheep  ” PART TWO THE BOY HAD BEEN WORKING FOR THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT for almost a would make him happy  The merchant spent the entire day pieces and not to break anything  some money aside  That morning he had done some calculating  if whole year to be able to buy some sheep  who pass at the bottom of the hill  ” might have died if we had come upon a snake  But that ’ s the way life is with sheep and with shepherds  ” The merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses  He was selling better than ever … as if time had turned back to the old days when the street had been one of Tangier ’ s major attractions  return to your sheep  Why ask more out of life  ” the merchant had never met the king  said  But the merchant understood what the boy had said  The boy ’ s having hired the boy  The boy was being paid more money than he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep  away from the business of the display  saying nothing about his dream  The treasure was now nothing but “ I don ’ t know anyone around here who would want to cross the pile of stones  You could build one in your backyard  ” wait on a customer who had entered the shop  him much  But we two have to live with our mistakes  ” “ Why did you think we should have the display  ” “ I want to get back to my sheep faster  We have to take doing to help us  It ’ s called the principle of favorability  Or beginner ’ s luck  ” during our lives  The most important is to believe only in the one He stopped there  His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the wanted to live his life in accordance with Muslim law  “ What ’ s the fifth obligation  ” the boy asked  merchant answered  “ The fifth obligation of every Muslim is a holy city of Mecca  “ Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids  When I was leave someone in charge of the shop  the crystals are delicate things  pilgrimage were poorer than I  “ All who went there were happy at having done so  They placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses  One of tired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his leather  ” “ Because it ’ s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive  That ’ s on living  want to dream about Mecca  I ’ ve already imagined a thousand times seven times I walk around it before allowing myself to touch it  I ’ ve dream about it  ” display  Not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way  now able to speak their strange language  Since that morning in the because Egypt was now just as distant a dream for him as was disembark at Tarifa as a winner  words … and about omens  One afternoon he had seen a man at the “ Let ’ s sell tea to the people who climb the hill  ” “ But we could sell tea in crystal glasses  The people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses  I have been told that beauty is the great seducer of men  ” “ What is it you ’ re looking for  ” asked the old merchant  earn the money to do so  ” deeply  and everything else there is to know about crystal  I know its is going to expand  And then I ’ ll have to change my way of life  ” that it hasn ’ t been too bad  The shop is exactly the size I always know how to deal with change  I ’ m used to the way I am  ” didn ’ t see before  every blessing ignored becomes a curse  I don ’ t want anything else in life  But you are forcing me to look at wealth worse than I did before you arrived  Because I know the things I thought the boy to himself  They went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to himself for being able to do so  There had been a time when he thought that his sheep could teach him everything he needed to know about the world  But they could never have taught him Arabic  There are probably other things in the world that the sheep can ’ t “ What does that mean  ” answered  “ But in your language it would be something like ‘ It is written  ’ ” there ’ s just no way to hold back the river  the top  But there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing beautiful crystal glasses  would be impressed by the beauty of the glassware  The other man remarked that tea was always more delicious when it was served in tradition in the Orient to use crystal glasses for tea because it had magical powers  climb the hill to see the shop that was doing something new in a trade that was so old  Other shops were opened that served tea in business  and his shop was sought out by men and women with a thirst for things new  THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN  IT HAD BEEN ELEVEN months and nine days since he had first set foot on the African continent  especially for this day  He put his headcloth in place and secured it descended the stairs silently  The city was still sleeping  He prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass  Then he sat in the sunfilled sound of the wind that brought the scent of the desert  When he had It was a bundle of money  Enough to buy himself a hundred and Africa into his own country  He waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop  Then the two went off to have some more tea  my sheep  And you have the money you need to go to Mecca  ” The old man said nothing  “ Will you give me your blessing  ” asked the boy  “ You have Then he turned to the boy  crystal shop  But you know that I ’ m not going to go to Mecca  Just as you know that you ’ re not going to buy your sheep  ” And he gave the boy his blessing  THE BOY WENT TO HIS ROOM AND PACKED HIS BELONGINGS  They filled three and Thummim  realize how long it had been since he had thought of him  For nearly aside enough money so that he could return to Spain with pride  omens  ” strange sensation that the old king was nearby  He had worked hard thought  Even though the sheep didn ’ t teach me to speak Arabic  But the sheep had taught him something even more important  language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying for something believed in and desired  Tangier was no longer a could conquer the world  dreams are but don ’ t want to realize them  The old king hadn ’ t told could build one in his backyard  And he had forgotten to mention The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things  He went down the stairs and found the merchant waiting on a foreign tea from crystal glasses  It was more activity than usual for this time the old merchant ’ s hair was very much like the hair of the old king  had also been like the old king ’ s smile  trying to realize their Personal Legend  He left without saying goodbye to the crystal merchant  He didn ’ t want to cry with the other people there  He was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned  He was more the world  longer happy with his decision  He had worked for an entire year to becoming less important  Maybe because that wasn ’ t really his dream  Who knows … maybe it ’ s better to be like the crystal merchant  boy thought — he came to the bar he had entered on his first day tea  done  But maybe I ’ ll never have another chance to get to the an entire desert between him and the Pyramids  Yet the boy felt that there was another way to regard his situation  he was actually two hours closer to his treasure … the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn ’ t matter  all the time I need  Why not  He suddenly felt tremendously happy  He could always go back to being a shepherd  He could always become a crystal salesman anyone  He was planning as he left the bar  He had remembered that one of the crystal merchant ’ s suppliers transported his crystal by means of caravans that crossed the desert  He held Urim and Thummim in to his treasure  What could it cost to go over to the supplier ’ s warehouse and find out if the Pyramids were really that far away  THE ENGLISHMAN WAS SITTING ON A BENCH IN A STRUCTURE that smelled of and here I am in a corral  But he had to move on  He believed in omens  All his life and all his studies were aimed at finding the one true language of the but his studies had taken him to a point beyond which he could not seem to go  He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an Work — the Philosopher ’ s Stone — and for this reason kept their knowledge to themselves  He had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his had purchased all the rarest and most important volumes on alchemist had visited Europe  It was said that he was more than two Stone and the Elixir of Life  The Englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story  But he would never have thought it more archaeological expedition in the desert — told him about an Arab that was possessed of exceptional powers  transform any metal into gold  ” The Englishman could not contain his excitement  He canceled all his commitments and pulled together the most important of his thought  And the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable  greeted the Englishman  “ Where are you bound  ” asked the young Arab  his reading  He didn ’ t want any conversation at this point  What he the alchemist would certainly put him to the test  The young Arab took out a book and began to read  The book other important things to do  burial scene that began the book  “ I ’ ve been trying for two years to concentrate  He still had some doubts about the decision he had made  But he was able to understand one thing  making a decision was only the diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision  a mystery to me  off the conversation  The boy closed his book  He felt that he didn ’ t want to do anything that might make him look like the Englishman  He took In a flash the boy put them back in his pocket  the earth  But those who know about such things would know that those are Urim and Thummim  I didn ’ t know that they had them in this part of the world  ” “ Did you say a king  ” he asked  “ I guess you don ’ t believe that a king would talk to someone like “ Not at all  It was shepherds who were the first to recognize a surprising that kings would talk to shepherds  ” me about Urim and Thummim  These stones were the only form of divination permitted by God  The priests carried them in a golden breastplate  ” The boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse  “ Who told you about omens  ” The boy ’ s interest was increasing by the moment  have to find a man who knows that universal language  An alchemist  ” The conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss  leaving today for AlFayoum  ” you  ” about the words luck and coincidence  It ’ s with those words that the universal language is written  ” He told the boy it was no coincidence that he had met him with were in search of the alchemist  regretted having said it  But the Englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it  the warehouse boss called to them to come outside  hold the power of life and death for every person I take with me  crazy  ” belts and rifles slung on their shoulders  The Englishman had the leader had to repeat himself several times for everyone to understand what he was saying  will do everything possible once again to win out over the desert  But I want each and every one of you to swear by the God you believe in that you will follow my orders no matter what  In the There was a murmur from the crowd  Each was swearing quietly to his or her own God  The boy swore to Jesus Christ  The Englishman said nothing  And the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have  The people were also praying to heaven for protection  uncertainly onto their backs  The boy felt sorry for the Englishman ’ s picking up the conversation where it had been interrupted in the warehouse  “ I ’ m here because a friend of mine heard of an Arab who … ” what the Englishman was saying  The boy knew what he was about boy  The caravan moved toward the east  It traveled during the spent most of his time with his books  The boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert  Now everything was quite different from mixed with the nervous orders of the guides and the merchants  and of the hoofbeats of the animals  Even the guides spoke very little to one another  remain silent  ” seems old and wise  had sat at the fort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face  It reminded him of the wool from his sheep … his sheep who were always had  probably already forgotten me  That ’ s good  Creatures like the probably wasn ’ t the only one  But he was excited at his intuitive understanding of the camel driver ’ s comment  maybe he was also learning the universal language that deals with the past and the boy was beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden was covered with the salt of driedup lakes  The animals balked at unburden their charges  The drivers carried the freight themselves appoint a new one  But all this happened for one basic reason  no matter how many his books  first few days of the journey  But he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind  As soon as he had a superstition that each time he opened the book he would learn He became friendly with the camel driver who traveled to the driver his adventures as a shepherd  and that made me feel good  never to me  My neighbors feared they would lose all their olive children  I thought that everything I owned would be destroyed  living  So now I ’ m a camel driver  But that disaster taught me to understand the word of Allah  people need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want  our possessions and property  But this fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand  ” something that the other needed — as if everything were indeed the desert  were Bedouins who did surveillance along the caravan route  They provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes  They came fire where the Englishman and the boy were sitting  “ There are The three fell silent  The boy noted that there was a sense of fear experiencing the language without words … the universal language  The Englishman asked if they were in danger  including the danger  ” And he concluded by saying the mysterious word  “ Maktub  ” Englishman  “ Books are like caravans in that respect  ” The immense collection of people and animals began to travel when the travelers were accustomed to talking around the fires — attract attention to the caravan  The travelers adopted the practice of arranging the animals in a the nocturnal cold  And the leader posted armed sentinels at the fringes of the group  The Englishman was unable to sleep one night  He called to the Englishman the story of his life  The Englishman was fascinated with the part about the progress achieved at the crystal shop after the boy began working there  World  It ’ s always a positive force  ” animal — or even just a simple thought  rarely recognize that it is working for us  But in the crystal shop you probably realized that even the glasses were collaborating in your success  ” The boy thought about that for a while as he looked at the moon and the bleached sands  “ I have watched the caravan as it crossed “ If either of us had joined this caravan based only on personal would have been much more difficult  ” They stood there looking at the moon  speaks to the soul of the desert  ” caravan  ” that seemed to repeat itself throughout all the books  all things are the manifestation of one thing only  In one of the books he learned that the most important text in inscribed on the surface of an emerald  might teach something to the boy  The book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists  They were men who had dedicated their entire lives to the purification of metals in their laboratories  they believed World  This Soul of the World allowed them to understand anything things communicated  They called that discovery the Master Work — it was part liquid and part solid  “ Can ’ t you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language  ” the boy asked  has to be followed exactly as it was followed by the masters  ” The boy learned that the liquid part of the Master Work was alchemist from growing old  And the solid part was called the Philosopher ’ s Stone  observing the fire that purified the metals  They spent so much time close to the fire that gradually they gave up the vanities of the world  They discovered that the purification of the metals had led to a purification of themselves  ” The boy thought about the crystal merchant  He had said that it could free himself from negative thoughts  The boy was becoming more and more convinced that alchemy could be learned in one ’ s daily life  fascinating property  A small sliver of the stone can transform large quantities of metal into gold  ” transform everything into gold  He read the lives of the various and Geber  They were fascinating stories  each of them lived out his Philosopher ’ s Stone and the Elixir of Life  But when the boy wanted to learn how to achieve the Master “ WHY DO THEY MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED  ” HE asked the Englishman and missed his books  “ So that those who have the responsibility for understanding can transforming lead into gold  Gold would lose its value  middle of the desert  I ’ m seeking a true alchemist who will help me to decipher the codes  ” “ When were these books written  ” the boy asked  “ Many centuries ago  ” argued  “ There was no way for everybody to know about alchemy  The Englishman didn ’ t answer him directly  He said that for the past few days he had been paying attention to how the caravan he had noticed was that talk of war was becoming more and more frequent  THEN ONE DAY THE BOY RETURNED THE BOOKS TO THE Englishman  “ Did might be  He needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war  understands that soul can also understand the language of things  I they could be written on the surface of an emerald  ” magic the strange and the laboratory equipment … none of this had made an impression on the boy  His He took back his books and packed them away again in their bags  and the sand raised by the animals  “ Everyone has his or her own THE CARAVAN BEGAN TO TRAVEL DAY AND NIGHT  THE hooded Bedouins had become a good friend of the boy ’ s — explained that the war between the tribes had already begun  The caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis  themselves less and less  The silence was the worst aspect of the because it might signal a raid  the threat of war  “ Because I don ’ t live in either my past or my future  I ’ m interested only in the present  If you can concentrate always on the looked for the star they followed every night  He thought that the stars on the desert itself  “ Because we have to sleep  ” early  But the boy was quiet  He was at home with the silence of the would just be a memory  But this was the present moment — the party the camel driver had mentioned — and he wanted to live it as he did the lessons of his past and his dreams of the future  Although could herald a miracle  as he watched the hundreds of people and animals arriving at the excitement at the arrival of the strangers  The alchemist saw the at length  But none of that mattered to the alchemist  He had already seen had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands  The dunes sands he had known since he was a child  He always enjoyed seeing Maybe God created the desert so that man could appreciate the date He decided to concentrate on more practical matters  He knew that in the caravan there was a man to whom he was to teach some of his secrets  The omens had told him so  He didn ’ t know the man He hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice  I don ’ t know why these things have to be transmitted by word of revealed his secrets easily to all his creatures  He had only one explanation for this fact  things have to be and this kind of life cannot be captured in pictures or words  wind up forgetting the Language of the World  being just a well surrounded by a few palm trees — as he had seen once in a geography book — was much larger than many towns back and innumerable colored tents spread among them  impatient to meet with the alchemist  animals and people that were arriving  The men of the oasis wanted with one another for access to the cloth and precious stones brought by the merchants  The silence of the desert was a distant world and found themselves once again in the world of people  They were relieved and happy  camel driver explained to the boy that oases were always inhabitants were women and children  There were oases leaving the oases as places of refuge  people together and gave them his instructions  The group was to remain there at the oasis until the conflict between the tribes was accommodations  That was the law of hospitality  Then he asked the men appointed by the tribal chieftains  may not shelter armies or troops  ” revolver out of his bag and gave it to the men who were collecting the arms  “ Why a revolver  ” he asked  seemed as if what the old king had called “ beginner ’ s luck ” were no constantly subjected to tests of his persistence and courage  So he he would fail to see the signs and omens left by God along his path  God placed them along my path  He had surprised himself with job  He had never thought of them in terms of a language used by God to indicate what he should do  driver said  ‘ Eat when it ’ s time to eat  And move along when it ’ s time to move along  ’ ” tent with five other young men of about his age  They were people tell them of his experiences at the crystal shop when the Englishman came into the tent  outside  “ I need you to help me find out where the alchemist lives  ” probably live in a manner that was different from that of the rest of the oasis was much larger than they could have imagined  there were hundreds of tents  sitting down with the boy near one of the wells  The Englishman didn ’ t want to tell others about his reasons for The boy approached a woman who had come to the well to fill a goatskin with water  alchemist lives here at the oasis  ” because they were married women  He should respect tradition  The Englishman was disappointed  It seemed he had made the long journey for nothing  The boy was also saddened  his friend was that ’ s what the old king had said  He couldn ’ t have been wrong  The Englishman ’ s eyes lit up  “ That ’ s it  Maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is  Find out who it is who cures the people ’ s illnesses  ” insistence  Then a man approached  “ Do you know someone here who cures people ’ s illnesses  ” the boy asked  strangers  “ You ’ re looking for witch doctors  ” He spoke some verses bucket  The boy repeated his question  “ Why do you want to find that sort of person  ” the Arab asked  “ Because my friend here has traveled for many months in order the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to  Only when he consents  “ Wait for the end of the war  Then leave with the caravan  Don ’ t But the Englishman was exultant  They were on the right track  ask about the alchemist  Soul of the World surged within him  When he looked into her dark he learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke — the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart  It was love  Something older than crystals and in the silence of the desert  It was the pure Language of the World  It required no endless time  What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in than of anything in the world  He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person before becoming committed  But maybe people who felt that way under the sun has been written by one hand only  It is the hand that the same  “ What ’ s your name  ” he asked  “ That ’ s what some women in my country are called  ” invaders carried the name everywhere  ” The beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride  man who cured people ’ s illnesses  said  “ He communicates with the genies of the desert  ” The genies were the spirits of good and evil  And the girl pointed she filled her vessel with water and left  day in Tarifa the levanter had brought to him the perfume of that she existed  He knew that his love for her would enable him to discover every treasure in the world  asked me if I had ever transformed lead into gold  I told him that was what I had come here to learn  “ He told me I should try to do so  That ’ s all he said  ‘ Go and try  ’ ” The boy didn ’ t say anything  The poor Englishman had traveled already done so many times  “ That ’ s what I ’ m going to do  I ’ m going to start now  ” water  my wife  I love you  ” “ I ’ m going to wait here for you every day  I have crossed the it brought me to you  ” The boy looked around him at the date palms  He reminded shepherd again  Fatima was more important than his treasure  if she had guessed what he was thinking  “ And the women of the desert are proud of their tribesmen  ” She refilled her vessel and left  The boy went to the well every day to meet with Fatima  He told of the caravan called a meeting of all of the people traveling with him  important to both armies  It ’ s not a battle of good against evil  It ’ s a Allah is on both sides  ” went to meet with Fatima that afternoon  He told her about the become a part of you  ” more beautiful than the sound of the wind in the date palms  “ I have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time  I which men of the desert expect women to behave  Ever since I was a The boy wanted to take her hand  But Fatima ’ s hands held to the handles of her jug  it  “ That ’ s why I want you to continue toward your goal  If you have our love for each other  come back one day  ” The boy was sad as he left her that day  He thought of all the married shepherds he had known  They had a difficult time convincing their wives that they had to go off into distant fields  Love required them to stay with the people they loved  hide in the ravines and of the water that comes from the earth  They become a part of everything … they become the Soul of the World  “ Some do come back  And then the other women are happy too will be one of the women who wait  The boy went to look for the Englishman  He wanted to tell him about Fatima  He was surprised when he saw that the Englishman they had when he was reading his books  was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the Master But I ’ m happy at least that I didn ’ t wait twenty years  ” desert turned pink in the setting sun  He felt the urge to go out into to become hypnotized by the horizon  He tried to deal with the He watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind  Although sense to the boy  It was just that he couldn ’ t grasp what it meant  He it  Maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership  everything in the world is beginning to make sense to me … even the materialized over the sands of the desert  But he certainly didn ’ t desire that an army invade the oasis  meditation  He tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the that wouldn ’ t allow him to do so  to occur  dangerous  observing the sunset  He saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes  answered  But the boy told him about the hawks  that he had been watching their flight and had suddenly felt himself to have plunged to the Soul of the World  The camel driver understood what the boy was saying  He knew that any given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history means of penetration to the Soul of the World  The desert was full of men who earned their living based on the ease with which they could penetrate to the Soul of the World  They would be impossible to be effective in battle if one knew that he was thrill of not knowing what the outcome would be  the future was of many things  Where was the enemy ’ s sword  Where was his horse  What kind of blow should one deliver next in order to consulted with seers  Many of them had been right about what they had ever sought out  and the one most to be feared  had asked why the camel driver was so interested in the future  change those things that I don ’ t want to happen  ” said  myself for what ’ s coming  ” greatly before they even occur  ” driver had said to the seer  “ And men always live their lives based on the future  ” The seer was a specialist in the casting of twigs  he threw them cloth and put them back in his bag  omens that are here in the present  guess at the future  Based on the omens of the present  The secret is The camel driver had asked what the circumstances were under which God would allow him to see the future  that was written so as to be altered  ” thought  Why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument  “ Tell them about the armies that are approaching  ” “ They ’ ll laugh at me  ” to dealing with omens  ” “ They ’ re not concerned with that right now  They believe that if someone will tell them about it  It has happened many times before  The boy thought of Fatima  And he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes  THE BOY APPROACHED THE GUARD AT THE FRONT OF THE huge white tent at the center of the oasis  “ I want to see the chieftains  I ’ ve brought omens from the desert  ” into the tent  conversation with her  boy was astonished by what he saw inside  Never could he have like this one  The ground was covered with the most beautiful resting upon richly embroidered silk cushions  Servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea  Other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs  The atmosphere was suffused with the sweet scent of smoke  which of them was the most important  an Arab dressed in white young Arab the boy had spoken with earlier  “ Who is this stranger who speaks of omens  ” asked one of the knows that we have been here for generations  ” said another of the chieftains  said  “ I can see things that eyes habituated to the desert might not see  ” to himself  third chieftain  you don ’ t have to do anything about it  ” The men fell into an animated discussion  They spoke in an told him that something was wrong  He regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert  and the boy felt better  The man hadn ’ t participated in the feel the vibrations of peace throughout the tent  Now his intuition was that he had been right in coming  The discussion ended  The chieftains were silent for a few moments as they listened to what the old man was saying  Then he turned to the boy  this time his expression was cold and distant  know that whoever believes in dreams also knows how to interpret them  ” “ We always observe the Tradition  The Tradition saved Egypt how their children should marry  The Tradition says that an oasis is vulnerable  ” No one said a word as the old man continued  “ But the Tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert  Everything we know was taught to us by the desert  ” again  no one at the oasis may carry arms  Throughout the entire day we will once again surrender their arms to me  For every ten dead men “ But arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle  Arms time they might not function  If at least one of them hasn ’ t been began to make his way there  He was alarmed by what had happened  He had succeeded in having done so might be his life  It was a frightening bet  But he had been making risky bets ever since the day he had sold his sheep to die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day  Every day was there to be lived or to mark one ’ s departure from this world  Everything depended on one word  “ Maktub  ” silence of the desert and Fatima ’ s eyes  He had lived every one of his days intensely since he had left home so long ago  If he died and he was proud of that  the ground by a wind such as he had never known  The area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view  Before frightening scream  what he saw  Astride the animal was a horseman dressed with a black kerchief  He appeared to be a messenger from the mere messenger  scabbard mounted on his saddle  The steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon  “ Who dares to read the meaning of the flight of the hawks  ” he fifty thousand palm trees of AlFayoum  except that now the roles were reversed  I was able to see through to the Soul of the World  ” until the point touched the boy ’ s forehead  It drew a droplet of blood  sense of joy  he was about to die in pursuit of his Personal Legend  that Soul  The stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy ’ s forehead  “ Why did you read the flight of the birds  ” “ I read only what the birds wanted to tell me  They wanted to men at the oasis than you have  ” The sword remained where it was  “ Who are you to change what Allah has willed  ” taught me the language of the birds  Everything has been written by words  the boy felt immensely relieved  But he still couldn ’ t flee  of the battle  ” The stranger seemed satisfied with the answer  But he kept the sword in his hand  “ What is a stranger doing in a strange land  ” “ I am following my Personal Legend  It ’ s not something you would understand  ” relaxed  quality most essential to understanding the Language of the World  ” The boy was surprised  The stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about  those who become distracted  ” What he said reminded the boy of the old king  The same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip  away  The hand with the whip pointed to the south  The boy had met the alchemist  throughout the palm trees at AlFayoum  Before the sun had horizon  The mounted troops entered the oasis from the north  it hidden in their robes  When they reached the white tent at the they attacked an empty tent  The men of the oasis surrounded the horsemen from the desert and within half an hour all but one of the intruders were dead  The and saw nothing of what had happened  The women had remained The only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion  asked him why he had violated the Tradition  The commander said return to the war  that the Tradition was sacred  He condemned the commander to desert wind  asked the boy to become the counselor of the oasis  and a group of Arabs passing by told the boy that it was a place inhabited by genies  But the boy sat down and waited  Not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view  He carried two dead hawks over his shoulder  Personal Legend that brings you here  ” desert  So I have come here  ” boy should enter the tent with him  It was a tent like many at the oasis  The boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus mysterious designs  said the alchemist  The boy suspected that they were the same hawks he had seen scent of the hookahs  “ Why did you want to see me  ” the boy asked  Englishman  He ’ s the one that ’ s looking for you  ” “ He has other things to do first  But he ’ s on the right track  He has begun to try to understand the desert  ” “ And what about me  ” Another person was there to help him toward his Personal Legend  “ So you are going to instruct me  ” “ No  You already know all you need to know  I am only going to point you in the direction of your treasure  ” “ I know what ’ s happening in the desert  ” “ I also have Fatima  She is a treasure greater than anything else I have won  ” They ate in silence  The alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy ’ s cup  It was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted  “ Isn ’ t wine prohibited here  ” the boy asked alchemist  “ It ’ s what comes out of their mouths that is  ” under a moon so brilliant that it made the stars pale  everything you have learned along the way can make sense  traitorous  they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire  they are about to die  ” where there is life out in the desert  Only those who can see such signs of life are able to find treasure  ” thought  I don ’ t know the desert that well yet  man  They reached the rocky place where the boy had seen the And then the boy understood  He loosened the reins on his followed as the boy ’ s horse ran for almost half an hour  They could no longer see the palms of the oasis — only the gigantic moon above alchemist ’ s eyes — the boy could see only his eyes — squinted with his effort  His arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the minutes  with the snakes of the desert  The boy watched as his companion went to his horse and then he placed the snake within it  The serpent relaxed immediately  “ Why was that so important  ” “ Because the Pyramids are surrounded by the desert  ” The boy didn ’ t want to talk about the Pyramids  His heart was continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon Fatima  treasure  ” knows that men have to go away in order to return  And she already has her treasure  it ’ s you  Now she expects that you will find what it is you ’ re looking for  ” “ Let me tell you what will happen  You ’ ll be the counselor of the oasis  You have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels  how the world is always changing  And you ’ ll get better and better there is  try to ignore them  You ’ ll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants  The tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do  And your camels will bring you wealth and power  she ’ ll return your love  You ’ ll remember that she never asked you to man  So you won ’ t blame her  But many times you ’ ll walk the sands could have trusted more in your love for Fatima  Because what kept you at the oasis was your own fear that you might never come back  forever  and a great deal of merchandise  You ’ ll spend the rest of your days it ’ s too late  “ You must understand that love never keeps a man from because it wasn ’ t true love … the love that speaks the Language of the World  ” slithered away among the rocks  The boy remembered the crystal Englishman in search of the alchemist  He thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert  And he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved  followed the alchemist back to the oasis  The wind brought the strange horseman with the falcon on his shoulder had spoken of Legend  in his heart  response  friend enough gold to buy a sheep  Then he asked his friend to go into the tent where Fatima was buy yet another sheep  sheep  Fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent  The two walked out among the palms  The boy knew that it was a violation of the coming back  I love you because … ” one is loved  No reason is needed for loving  ” the entire universe conspired to help me find you  ” The two embraced  It was the first time either had touched the other  then  ” They said nothing else  They walked a bit farther among the said  He saw that Fatima ’ s eyes were filled with tears  “ You ’ re crying  ” out to do the chores she had done for years  But everything had never again have the same meaning it had had only yesterday  It would no longer be a place with fifty thousand palm trees and three place for her  boy was following in search of his treasure  She would have to send the hope for his return  the boy as they began to ride across the sands of the desert  forever  ” boy said  He was already reaccustomed to the desert ’ s silence  one can always come back  If what you had found was only a on your return  ” The man was speaking the language of alchemy  But the boy knew that he was referring to Fatima  It was difficult not to think about what he had left behind  The camel driver who was a teacher without realizing it  Maybe the speaking only of the precautions they needed to follow in order to failed to observe  offered his water container to the boy  “ I congratulate you for having pursued your Personal Legend  ” thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know  A alchemy  But I wasn ’ t able to learn anything from them  ” through action  Everything you need to know you have learned through your journey  You need to learn only one thing more  ” “ Why are you called the alchemist  ” “ Because that ’ s what I am  ” “ And what went wrong when other alchemists tried to make gold and were unable to do so  ” wanting actually to live out the Personal Legend  ” “ What is it that I still need to know  ” the boy asked  But the alchemist continued to look to the horizon  And finally the falcon returned with their meal  They dug a hole and lit their fire feel that they knew a better way than others had  Yet the Emerald Tablet is still alive today  ” “ What was written on the Emerald Tablet  ” the boy wanted to know  as if it had taken place years and years ago  The boy tried to read what was written in the sand  saw in the Englishman ’ s books  ” hawks  it can ’ t be understood by reason alone  The Emerald Tablet is a direct passage to the Soul of the World  “ The wise men understood that this natural world is only an image and a copy of paradise  The existence of this world is simply a guarantee that there exists a world that is perfect  God created the spiritual teachings and the marvels of his wisdom  That ’ s what I mean by action  ” “ Should I understand the Emerald Tablet  ” the boy asked  the right time to study the best way to understand the Emerald Tablet  But you are in the desert  So immerse yourself in it  The on the face of the earth will do that  You don ’ t even have to understand the desert  all you have to do is contemplate a simple “ How do I immerse myself in the desert  ” THEY CROSSED THE DESERT FOR ANOTHER TWO DAYS IN silence  The approaching the area where the most violent battles were being times it became so emotional over the desert sunrise that the boy had to hide his tears  His heart beat fastest when it spoke to the boy when the boy and the alchemist had fallen into silence  they had made camp that day  treasure  ” when I ’ m thinking about her  ” has to say  ” boy ’ s heart began to speak of fear  It told him stories it had heard treasure and never succeeded  Sometimes it frightened the boy with satisfied  it had found love and riches  had paused to rest the horses  “ It doesn ’ t want me to go on  ” you ’ ve won  ” “ Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet  Even if and about the world  ” “ Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly  If you know your “ You will never be able to escape from your heart  So it ’ s better unanticipated blow  ” The boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the suffer terribly  ” alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky  “ Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself  And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in second ’ s encounter with God and with eternity  ” was a part of the dream that I would find it  When I have been truly I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that seemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve  ” things that came from the Soul of the World  It said that all people who are happy have God within them  And that happiness could be has taken millions of years to create it  “ Everyone on earth has a want to go in search of them  We speak of them only to children  we don ’ t want people to suffer because they don ’ t follow their hearts  ” “ Why don ’ t people ’ s hearts tell them to continue to follow their dreams  ” the boy asked the alchemist  like to suffer  ” message  understood that the boy ’ s heart had returned to the Soul of the World  “ So what should I do now  ” the boy asked  “ And continue to pay heed to the omens  Your heart is still capable of showing you where the treasure is  ” “ Is that the one thing I still needed to know  ” everything that was learned along the way  It does this not because master the lessons we ’ ve learned as we ’ ve moved toward that dream  That ’ s the point at which most people give up  It ’ s the point just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon  ’ “ Every search begins with beginner ’ s luck  And every search ends with the victor ’ s being severely tested  ” The boy remembered an old proverb from his country  It said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn  the alchemist were doing there  “ We ’ re going to have to search you to see whether you ’ re had searched the boy ’ s bag  The tribesman who was searching the alchemist ’ s belongings that was slightly larger than a chicken ’ s egg  “ What are these things  ” he asked  “ That ’ s the Philosopher ’ s Stone and the Elixir of Life  It ’ s the Master Work of the alchemists  Whoever swallows that elixir will into gold  ” alchemist to proceed with all of their belongings  moved on  “ What did you do that for  ” the boy ’ s heart became more and more silent  It no longer wanted to know about things of the past or future  it was content simply to was capable now of betraying the other  the desert were wearisome  His heart told the boy what his strongest qualities were  his courage in having given up his sheep during the time he had worked at the crystal shop  And his heart told him something else that the boy had never he had never perceived  His heart said that one time it had hidden that the boy might wound himself  And it reminded the boy of the he had fallen into a deep sleep  There had been two thieves farther ahead who were planning to steal the boy ’ s sheep and murder him  thinking that he had changed his route  “ Does a man ’ s heart always help him  ” the boy asked the alchemist  “ Mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their “ Does that mean that I ’ ll never run into danger  ” said  tribes  At each corner of the camp were Arabs garbed in beautiful hookahs and trading stories from the battlefield  No one paid any attention to the two travelers  the encampment  forget that you ’ re in the desert  When men are at war with one one fails to suffer the consequences of everything under the sun  ” appeared from behind the travelers  where the tribes are at war  ” straight into the eyes of the horsemen  They were silent for a move along  The boy watched the exchange with fascination  “ You dominated alchemist  been one who stared fixedly at the two  He had been so far away that his face wasn ’ t even visible  But the boy was certain that he had been looking at them  only two days from the Pyramids  teach me about alchemy  ” “ You already know about alchemy  It is about penetrating to the reserved for you  ” into gold  ” only after they had stopped to eat  don ’ t know why  I just know that the Tradition is always right  conflict  ” But then he stopped  The alchemist probably already knew all that  thing evolves as well  “ Others stumbled upon the stone by accident  They already had of others  But they don ’ t count  They ’ re quite rare  iron have their own Personal Legends to fulfill  And anyone who interferes with the Personal Legend of another thing never will discover his own  ” The alchemist ’ s words echoed out like a curse  He reached over and picked up a shell from the ground  The alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear  He had of the sea  Legend  And it will never cease doing so until the desert is once again covered by water  ” Pyramids of Egypt  THE SUN WAS SETTING WHEN THE BOY ’ S HEART SOUNDED a danger signal  alchemist to see whether he had sensed anything  But he appeared horsemen waiting ahead of them  Before he could say anything to hundred  And then they were everywhere in the dunes  surrounding their turbans  Their faces were hidden behind blue souls  And their eyes spoke of death  THE TWO WERE TAKEN TO A NEARBY MILITARY CAMP  A soldier shoved the boy and the alchemist into a tent where the chief was holding a meeting with his staff  “ You were seen at the enemy camp three days ago  And you were talking with one of the troops there  ” said the alchemist  “ I have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes  I was simply acting as a guide for my friend here  ” “ Who is your friend  ” the chief asked  nature  And he wants to show you his extraordinary powers  ” The boy listened quietly  And fearfully  “ What is a foreigner doing here  ” asked another of the men  alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief  The Arab accepted them without a word  There was enough there to buy a lot of weapons  “ It ’ s a man who understands nature and the world  If he wanted knew that the wind could not deliver them a fatal blow  Yet each felt were fearful of sorcerers  tribe  ” of the tent  But the boy couldn ’ t even speak  He was able to do so only after they had walked through the center of the camp  There was no need an impenetrable wall  “ You gave them everything I had  ” the boy said  “ Everything I ’ ve saved in my entire life  ” alchemist answered  “ Your money saved us for three days  It ’ s not often that money saves a person ’ s life  ” But the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom  He had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind  He wasn ’ t an alchemist  alchemist muttered some words that the boy didn ’ t understand  “ But I have no idea how to turn myself into the wind  ” everything he needs to know  There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve  the fear of failure  ” “ I ’ m not afraid of failing  It ’ s just that I don ’ t know how to turn myself into the wind  ” “ But what if I can ’ t  ” “ Then you ’ ll die in the midst of trying to realize your Personal who never even knew what their Personal Legends were  of death makes people a lot more aware of their lives  ” number of wounded were brought back to the camp  The dead of his companions  “ You could have died after peace had been who had taken his falcon out into the desert  repeated  “ Remember what I told you  the world is only the visible aspect of God  And that what alchemy does is to bring spiritual perfection into contact with the material plane  ” “ What are you doing  ” “ Feeding my falcon  ” the boy said  “ Why feed your falcon  ” know how to turn myself into the wind  ” camp  The sentinels allowed him to go  they had already heard He spent the entire afternoon of the second day looking out over sensed his fear  They both spoke the same language  himself into the wind  ” The boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day  He told them all to be seated  desert  ” The boy looked out at the horizon  There were mountains in the living where survival seemed impossible  There was the desert that palm trees and three hundred wells  “ What do you want here today  ” the desert asked him  “ Didn ’ t you spend enough time looking at me yesterday  ” the wind  ” “ What is love  ” the desert asked  generous to him  ” answered  “ To nourish the falcon  And the falcon then nourishes will once again flourish  That ’ s how the world goes  ” “ So is that what love is  ” “ But you can at least understand that somewhere in your sands there is a woman waiting for me  And that ’ s why I have to turn myself into the wind  ” The desert didn ’ t answer him for a few moments  wind  ” A breeze began to blow  The tribesmen watched the boy from a couldn ’ t understand  The alchemist smiled  The wind approached the boy and touched his face  It knew of to die  loved one to me  ” “ Who taught you to speak the language of the desert and the wind  ” things  ” I love  ” “ I heard what you were talking about the other day with the Personal Legend  But people can ’ t turn themselves into the wind  ” “ So you and I can talk about the limitless possibilities of people and the winds  ” know how to turn a man into the wind  And look how many things that there were other things the wind should be able to do  wind  And it knew nothing about love  having to acknowledge its own limitations  “ Maybe it ’ s better to ask heaven  ” sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun  Then I can look to heaven without blinding myself  ” sand  The sun was turned into a golden disk  desert were already familiar with that wind  They called it the and all their weapons were filled with sand  They could barely see the boy  Their faces were covered with the “ I want to see how a man turns himself into the wind  ” But he made a mental note of the names of the two men who had are not afraid  grow and the sheep to seek out shade  From where I am — and I ’ m a long way from the earth — I learned how to love  I know that if I and the Soul of the World would no longer exist  So we contemplate and it gives me my reason for living  ” great length to each other during this endless trip through the only the minerals and vegetables understand that all things are one  the same as gold  Each performs its own exact function as a unique that wrote all this had stopped on the fifth day of creation  the boy said  “ But you don ’ t know about love  If there hadn ’ t been a but one day that Personal Legend will be realized  So each thing has thing only  ” was in his former life  Lead will play its role until the world has no further need for lead  and then lead will have to turn itself into gold  too  ” asked the boy  roam the world like the wind  And it ’ s not love to see everything become better or worse  And that ’ s where the power of love comes we are  ” “ So what do you want of me  ” the sun asked  answered  “ But I don ’ t know how to turn you into the wind  ” and wanted to tell every corner of the world that the sun ’ s wisdom had its limitations  That it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the Language of the World  each other as they sought to keep from being blown away  speak  prayer without words or pleas  His prayer didn ’ t give thanks for his sheep having found new pastures  it didn ’ t ask that the boy be able to sell more crystal  and it didn ’ t beseech that the woman he had single emerald  He saw that omens were scattered throughout the man into the wind  Because only the hand understood that it was a larger design that had moved the universe to the point at which six days of creation had evolved into a Master Work  it was a part of the Soul of God  And he saw that the Soul of God was THE SIMUM BLEW THAT DAY AS IT HAD NEVER BLOWN before  For where the boy had been  But he was no longer there  he was camp  The men were terrified at his sorcery  But there were two the glory of God  them as far as they chose  the escorts they could return to the camp  only three hours from the Pyramids  ” World  ” “ I only invoked what you already knew  ” The alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery  A monk dressed in black came to the gates  They spoke for a few minutes in smiled  They went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery  The which the alchemist placed in an iron pan  When the lead had and added it to the pan in which the lead had melted  The monk was irritated  The caravans had been stopped at Giza the monk said  longer lead  It was gold  “ Will I learn to do that someday  ” the boy asked  answered  “ But I wanted to show you that it was possible  ” alchemist separated the disk into four parts  monk  “ It ’ s for your generosity to the pilgrims  ” responded  the next time  ” The alchemist turned to the boy  “ This is for you  To make up for what you gave to the general  ” The boy was about to say that it was much more than he had alchemist said to the monk  He took the fourth part and handed it to the monk  “ This is for the boy  If he ever needs it  ” close to it now  ” “ Then why this  ” “ Because you have already lost your savings twice  Once to the happens once can never happen again  But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time  ’ ” They mounted their horses  The boy brought his horse closer  sent to the most distant regions of the empire  The other son was a and told him that the words of one of his sons would be learned and repeated throughout the world for all generations to come  The proud to know  who was about to be crushed by the wheels of a chariot  Since he in his dream  any wish you desire  ’ son ’ s poems will be read by men for generations to come  I don ’ t want anything for myself  But any father would be proud of the to see my son ’ s words  ’ surrounded by thousands of people speaking a strange language  “ The man wept with happiness  angel through his tears  ‘ Can you please tell me which of my son ’ s poems these people are repeating  ’ “ ‘ The verses of your son who was the poet were very popular in words you ’ re hearing now are those of your son in the military  ’ “ The man looked at the angel in surprise  he was seeking was the Son of God  He met others who had been where the man he was looking for was visiting  ’ rabbi made ready to go to his house with him  But the centurion was he was surely in the presence of the Son of God  ’ under my roof  But only speak a word and my servant will be healed  ” ” ’ earth plays a central role in the history of the world  And normally he doesn ’ t know it  ” The boy smiled  He had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd  avidly to what his heart had to say  It was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden  alchemist had told him  story of a shepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had many men who had wandered in search of distant lands or beautiful change  “ Be aware of the place where you are brought to tears  That ’ s where The boy climbed the dune slowly  A full moon rose again in the starry sky  it had been a month since he had set forth from the oasis  appearance of a rolling sea  it reminded the boy of the day when journey in search of treasure  illuminated by the light of the moon and the brightness of the The boy fell to his knees and wept  He thanked God for making for his having met a woman of the desert who had told him that love would never keep a man from his Personal Legend  He didn ’ t need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone  The everything he might have dreamed of  reminded himself that no project is completed until its objective has he thought of what the crystal merchant had once said  that anyone could build a pyramid in his backyard  The boy could see now that he couldn ’ t do so if he placed stone upon stone for the rest of his life  but found nothing  He felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the Pyramids had been built  But he didn ’ t stop  He struggled sand back into the excavation  His hands were abraded and his tears fell  heard footsteps  Several figures approached him  Their backs were faces  “ What are you doing here  ” one of the figures demanded  other figure said  “ What are you hiding there  ” But one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the gold  in the man ’ s eyes the boy saw death  “ He ’ s probably got more gold hidden in the ground  ” near  “ What good is money to you if you ’ re going to die  It ’ s not often that he had twice dreamed of a treasure hidden near the Pyramids of Egypt  The man who appeared to be the leader of the group spoke to one of the others  “ Leave him  He doesn ’ t have anything else  He must have stolen this gold  ” look for a ruined church where shepherds and their sheep slept  In would find a hidden treasure  But I ’ m not so stupid as to cross an entire desert just because of a recurrent dream  ” And they disappeared  heart bursting with joy  Because now he knew where his treasure was  EPILOGUE could still be seen through the halfdestroyed roof  He remembered the time he had been there with his sheep  it had been a peaceful night … except for the dream  He sat looking at the sky for a long time  Then he took from his looked at the stars and drank wine together  He thought of the many show him his treasure  If he hadn ’ t believed in the significance of himself  began to dig at the base of the sycamore  whole story  You even left a bit of gold at the monastery so I could get back to this church  The monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters  Couldn ’ t you have saved me from that  ” with jewels  The spoils of a conquest that the country had long ago about  The boy took out Urim and Thummim from his bag  He had used marketplace  His life and his path had always provided him with enough omens  He placed Urim and Thummim in the chest  They were also a It ’ s true  life really is generous to those who pursue their to get to Tarifa so he could give onetenth of his treasure to the he thought  Maybe it was because they moved

<pre>&#39;ALCHEMIST PAULO COELHO TRANSLATED BY ALAN R  CLARKE Contents INTRODUCTION I remember receiving a letter from the American publisher Harper Collins … PROLOGUE The alchemist picked up a book that someone in the … ONE The boy ’ s name was Santiago  Dusk was falling as the … TWO The boy had been working for the crystal merchant for … EPILOGUE church just as night … ABOUT THE AUTHOR INTERNATIONAL ACCLAIM BOOKS BY PAULO COELHO CREDITS COVER COPYRIGHT ABOUT THE PUBLISHER TEN YEARS ON I REMEMBER RECEIVING A LETTER FROM THE AMERICAN publisher Harper Collins that said that  “ reading The Alchemist was like getting up at dawn and seeing the sun rise while the rest of the world still slept  ” I struggling to establish myself as a writer and to follow my path despite all the voices telling me it was impossible  Brazilian journalist phoned to say that President Clinton had been Roberts declaring that she adored the book  Walking alone down a The Alchemist  ” What ’ s the secret behind such a huge success  that God chose for you here on Earth  Whenever we do something we don ’ t all have the courage to confront our own dream  Why  There are four obstacles  First  we are told from childhood onward that everything we want to do is impossible  We grow up calling is so deeply buried in our soul as to be invisible  But it ’ s still there  afraid of hurting those around us by abandoning everything in order to pursue our dream  We do not realize that love is just a We do not realize that those who genuinely wish us well want us to be happy and are prepared to accompany us on that journey  against the third obstacle  fear of the defeats we will meet on the didn ’ t really want it anyway  ” We do want it and know that we have staked everything on it and that the path of the personal calling is patience in difficult times and to know that the Universe is I ask myself  are defeats necessary  up eight times  only going to suffer more than other people  do — we are filled by a greater sense of euphoria and confidence  In unexpected suffering passes more quickly than suffering that is to free ourselves from the bitterness and it stays with us for the rest of our lives  the very next day  Then comes the fourth obstacle  the fear of realizing the dream for which we fought all our lives  Oscar Wilde said  “ Each man kills the thing he loves  ” And it ’ s true  The mere possibility of getting what we want fills the soul of the ordinary person with guilt  We look around at all those who have failed to get what they want and feel that we do not deserve to get what we want either  We forget about all the obstacles we series of stupid mistakes and never reached their goal — when it was only a step away  This is the most dangerous of the obstacles because it has a kind of saintly aura about it  renouncing joy and conquest  But if you and you understand why you are here  Paulo Coelho Rio de Janeiro November 2002 Translated by Margaret Jull Costa PROLOGUE Translated by Clifford E  Landers THE ALCHEMIST PICKED UP A BOOK THAT SOMEONE IN THE caravan had Narcissus  daily beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty  He was so called the narcissus  But this was not how the author of the book ended the story  transformed into a lake of salty tears  “ Why do you weep  ” the goddesses asked  contemplate his beauty close at hand  ” “ But … was Narcissus beautiful  ” the lake asked  “ Who better than you to know that  ” the goddesses said in contemplate himself  ” PART ONE THE BOY ’ S NAME WAS SANTIAGO  DUSK WAS FALLING AS the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church  The roof had fallen in long sacristy had once stood  He decided to spend the night there  He saw to it that all the across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night  searching for it  he had just finished reading as a pillow  He told himself that he made more comfortable pillows  the stars through the halfdestroyed roof  before it ended  animals also began to stir  It was as if some mysterious energy could be the other way around  that it was he who had become accustomed to their schedule  But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken  name  He had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said  So there were times when he read them would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in the fields  Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed  But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one they would reach in about four days  He had been to the village only until the afternoon  So the boy sat on the steps of the shop and took a book from his bag  behind him  each day was like all the others  The shepherd told her of the where he had stopped  It was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep  “ How did you learn to read  ” the girl asked at one point  The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question  He was sure the girl would never days  He recognized that he was feeling something he had never experienced before  the desire to live in one place forever  With the four sheep  He paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year  AND NOW IT WAS ONLY FOUR DAYS BEFORE HE WOULD BE back in that same selling their wool  other places  ” But in his heart he knew that it did matter  And he knew that town where there was someone who could make them forget the joys of carefree wandering  thought  Maybe that ’ s why they always stay close to me  The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water  seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk  and they had the boy told them about the sights of the cities  They were content nourishment  him to feel anger toward his faithful companions  He drank a bit and he gathered his jacket closer to his body  He knew that a few great that he would not be able to lead his flock across the fields  It was the time of day when all of Spain slept during the summer  The jacket  But when he thought to complain about the burden of its withstood the cold of the dawn  grateful for the jacket ’ s weight and warmth  explain to the girl how it was that a simple shepherd knew how to read  That he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen  His pride for a simple farm family  They worked hard just to have food didn ’ t want to become a priest  That he wanted to travel  they leave they are basically the same people they were when they thinking that the past was better than what we have now  They have who live right here  ” boy explained  son  who travel are the shepherds  ” that held three ancient Spanish gold coins  “ I found these one day in the fields  I wanted them to be a part of women are the most beautiful  ” And he gave the boy his blessing  The boy could see in his happy  he had already seen many castles and met many women  but none the equal of the one who awaited him several days hence   He through those parts many times  The world was huge and inexhaustible  he had only to allow his sheep to set the route for a is that they don ’ t even realize that they ’ re walking a new road every day  They don ’ t see that the fields are new and the seasons change  All they think about is food and water  thought of other women since I met the merchant ’ s daughter  had arrived there before him and asked for her hand  It ’ s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life there was an old woman who interpreted dreams  THE OLD WOMAN LED THE BOY TO A ROOM AT THE BACK of her house  it was separated from her living room by a curtain of colored beads  The It sounded like a Gypsy prayer  The boy had already had had no flocks of sheep  People said that Gypsies spent their lives always been frightened to death that he would be captured by his hands in hers  showing the old woman that he was fearful  He recited an Our Father silently  the woman sensed it  He quickly pulled his hands away  regretting having come  He thought for a moment that it would be giving too much importance to his recurrent dream  old woman  “ And dreams are the language of God  When he speaks and that ’ s what makes a shepherd ’ s life exciting  sheep are afraid of strangers  But children always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them  I don ’ t know why  I don ’ t know how animals know the age of human beings  ” give you a lot of time  ” both hands and transported me to the Egyptian pyramids  ” He paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the Egyptian pyramids were  But she said nothing  times  ” The woman was silent for some time  Then she again took his hands and studied them carefully  The boy laughed — out of happiness  He was going to be able to save the little money he had because of a dream about hidden treasure  your treasure in exchange for what I am going to tell you  ” The shepherd swore that he would  The old woman asked him to swear again while looking at the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus  that I deserve a part of what you find  “ And this is my interpretation  you must go to the Pyramids in you a rich man  ” out the old woman for this  But then he remembered that he wasn ’ t going to have to pay anything  “ I told you that your dream was a difficult one  It ’ s the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary  only wise men are “ I only interpret dreams  I don ’ t know how to turn them into reality  That ’ s why I have to live off what my daughters provide me with  ” “ And what if I never get to Egypt  ” “ Then I don ’ t get paid  It wouldn ’ t be the first time  ” wasted too much time with him  So the boy was disappointed  he decided that he would never again believe in dreams  He remembered that he had a number of things he had to take care of  he went to the market for something bench in the plaza where he could sample the new wine he had The boy knew a lot of people in the city  That was what made need to spend all of his time with them  When someone sees the they wind up becoming a part of that person ’ s life  And then they want the person to change  If someone isn ’ t what others want them her own  He decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky before following his flock back through the fields  Three days from He started to read the book he had bought  On the very first page it described a burial ceremony  And the names of the people reader wouldn ’ t have to worry about memorizing a lot of names  down at his side and tried to strike up a conversation  in the plaza  wanted to concentrate on his reading  who was capable of doing difficult things  He had already imagined he explained that the sheep had to be sheared from back to front  He also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared them as if they were from his personal experience  She would never hoping that the old man would leave him alone  ashamed and decide of his own accord to change benches  irritating  ” “ It ’ s a book that says the same thing almost all the other books in inability to choose their own Personal Legends  And it ends up saying that everyone believes the world ’ s greatest lie  ” surprised  That ’ s the world ’ s greatest lie  ” travel  ” want to return it at all  The boy noticed that the man ’ s clothing was parts  Africa was only a few hours from Tarifa  one had only to cross shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day  “ Where are you from  ” the boy asked  “ From many places  ” from a city near an ancient castle  That ’ s where I was born  ” fearing that he would appear ignorant  He looked at the people in seemed to be very busy  “ It ’ s like it always has been  ” No clue yet  But he knew that Salem wasn ’ t in Andalusia  If it “ And what do you do in Salem  ” he insisted  king of Salem  ” alone with one ’ s books  They tell their incredible stories at the time they say some things that are so strange that you don ’ t know how to continue the conversation  do you have  ” know more about his life  you ’ ve got enough sheep  ” The boy was getting irritated  He wasn ’ t asking for help  It was the conversation  sheep and get going  ” you how to find the hidden treasure  ” old man — maybe he was her husband — was going to find a way to get much more money in exchange for information about something Something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded  With a movement that was too read what the old man had written in the sand  names of his father and his mother and the name of the seminary he awed and embarrassed  “ For several reasons  But let ’ s say that the most important is that you have succeeded in discovering your Personal Legend  ” The boy didn ’ t know what a person ’ s “ Personal Legend ” was  impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend  ” None of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy  But he wanted to know what the “ mysterious force ” was  the merchant ’ s daughter would be impressed when he told her about that  how to realize your Personal Legend  It prepares your spirit and universe  It ’ s your mission on earth  ” “ Even when all you want to do is travel  Or marry the daughter of a textile merchant  ” and jealousy  To realize one ’ s Personal Legend is a person ’ s only real obligation  All things are one  helping you to achieve it  ” townspeople  It was the old man who spoke first  “ Why do you tend a flock of sheep  ” “ Because I like to travel  ” The old man pointed to a baker standing in his shop window at shepherds sleep out in the open  Parents would rather see their children marry bakers than shepherds  ” daughter  There was surely a baker in her town  about shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them than their own Personal Legends  ” as he himself had been interrupted  “ Why are you telling me all this  ” “ Because you are trying to realize your Personal Legend  And you are at the point where you ’ re about to give it all up  ” “ And that ’ s when you always appear on the scene  ” people don ’ t realize I ’ ve done them  ” had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds  For five years thousands of stones looking for an emerald  The miner was about to more stone — just one more — he would find his emerald  Since the decided to become involved  He transformed himself into a stone it aside  But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone beautiful emerald in the world  The boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure  flock  ” “ What about onetenth of my treasure  ” The old man looked disappointed  “ If you start out by promising toward getting it  ” The boy told him that he had already promised to give onetenth of his treasure to the Gypsy  life has its price  This is what the Warriors of the Light try to teach  ” The old man returned the book to the boy  And I will tell you how to find the hidden treasure  Good afternoon  ” And he vanished around the corner of the plaza  man was right  He went over to the bakery and bought a loaf of the old man had said about him  Sometimes it ’ s better to leave the way things were  The boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the baker  So he began to wander through the he knew that Egypt was in Africa  “ Can I help you  ” asked the man behind the window  strait  The idea frightened him  watching the boy walk away  “ He doesn ’ t have enough money to travel  ” years he had learned everything about shepherding  he knew how the sheep from wolves  He knew all the fields and pastures of Andalusia  And he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals  He decided to return to his friend ’ s stable by the longest route all of Spain  the plaza where he had talked with the old man  Curse the moment I a woman who could interpret his dream  Neither the woman nor the old man was at all impressed by the fact that he was a shepherd  and didn ’ t understand that shepherds become attached to their sheep  He knew everything about each member of his flock  he The wind began to pick up  He knew that wind  people called it the eastern end of the Mediterranean  something he had become accustomed to and something he wanted didn ’ t even remember him  He was sure that it made no difference recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises  to come and go from the baker ’ s shop  A young couple sat on the brought the smell of the desert and of veiled women  It had brought with it the sweat and the dreams of men who had once left to search that he could have the same freedom  There was nothing to hold the fields of Andalusia were only steps along the way to his Personal Legend  sheep with him  sheep immediately  He said that he had always dreamed of being a almost sure to win  Beginner ’ s luck  ” “ Why is that  ” “ Because there is a force that wants you to realize your Personal Legend  it whets your appetite with a taste of success  ” wool  “ Where is the treasure  ” he asked  The boy was startled  The old woman had said the same thing  But she hadn ’ t charged him anything  God has prepared a path for everyone to follow  You just have to read the omens that he left for you  ” between him and the old man  He remembered something his grandfather had once told him  that butterflies were a good omen  clovers  “ Just as your grandfather taught you  These are good omens  ” precious stones  The boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day  He really was a king  He must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves  black stone that had been embedded at the center of the breastplate  “ They are called Urim and Thummim  The black question  at the Pyramids  that you already knew  But I had to insist on the payment of six sheep because I helped you to make your decision  ” make his own decisions  “ Don ’ t forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and don ’ t forget to follow your Personal Legend through to its conclusion  “ A certain shopkeeper sent his son to learn about the secret of happiness from the wisest man in the world  The lad wandered of the most delicious food in that part of the world  The wise man before it was his turn to be given the man ’ s attention  “ The wise man listened attentively to the boy ’ s explanation of explain the secret of happiness  He suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in two hours  to spill  ’ “ The boy began climbing and descending the many stairways of returned to the room where the wise man was  that are hanging in my dining hall  Did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create  Did you notice the beautiful parchments in my library  ’ nothing  His only concern had been not to spill the oil that the wise man had entrusted to him  wise man  ‘ You cannot trust a man if you don ’ t know his house  ’ related in detail everything he had seen  “ ‘ But where are the drops of oil I entrusted to you  ’ asked the wise man  gone  wisest of wise men  ‘ The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels The shepherd said nothing  He had understood the story the old never forget about his sheep  much change  All they wanted was food and water  Melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out seen Abraham again after having charged him his onetenth fee  That was his work  Personal Legends  But the king of Salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful  thought  I should have repeated it for him  Then when he spoke sometimes has to take some pride in himself  ” He was sitting in a bar very much like the other bars he had seen along the narrow streets of Tangier  Some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other  In just a few chanted — as everyone about him went to their knees and placed their foreheads on the ground  had always looked at the image of Saint Santiago Matamoros on his kneeling at his feet  The boy felt ill and terribly alone  The infidels had an evil look about them  time  only Arabic was spoken in this country  drink that had been served at the next table  It turned out to be a bitter tea  The boy preferred wine  But he didn ’ t need to worry about that right now  What he had about getting it  The sale of his sheep had left him with enough man had known what he was talking about  during the time the boy which path he should take by observing the ground and the sky  He had discovered that the presence of a certain bird meant that a was water in the area  The sheep had taught him that  “ Who are you  ” he heard a voice ask him in Spanish  someone had appeared  “ How come you speak Spanish  ” he asked  The new arrival was a was from this city  He was about the same age and height as the boy  “ Almost everyone here speaks Spanish  We ’ re only two hours from Spain  ” ask for a glass of wine for me  I hate this tea  ” religion here forbids it  ” The boy told him then that he needed to get to the Pyramids  He payment for taking him there  He remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn ’ t even have yet  “ I ’ d like you to take me there if you can  I can pay you to serve as my guide  ” “ Do you have any idea how to get there  ” the newcomer asked  listening attentively to their conversation  He felt uneasy at the out on an opportunity  enough  ” The boy thought it a strange question  But he trusted in the old universe always conspires in your favor  He took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young irritated  leave  ” grabbed him and began to speak to him in an angry stream of has its thieves  ” The boy trusted his new friend  He had helped him out in a dangerous situation  He took out his money and counted it  taking the money  “ But I have to buy two camels  ” They walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier  Everywhere there were stalls with items for sale  They reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held  There were that would be unfriendly  He knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in  than his friend  most beautiful sword he had ever seen  The scabbard was embossed to his friend  Then he realized that he had been distracted for a few he knew what he would find  He continued to look at the beautiful around  could he find his new companion  The boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident  He decided to stay right there and nearby tower and began his chant  everyone in the market fell to stalls and left  houses surrounding the plaza  He recalled that when the sun had morning he had known everything that was going to happen to him where he couldn ’ t even speak the language  He was no longer a start everything over  could have changed so suddenly and so drastically  He was so ashamed that he wanted to cry  He had never even and because this was the way God repaid those who believed in their dreams  now I ’ m sad and alone  I ’ m going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me  I ’ m going to hate those who have found their treasure because I never found mine  And I ’ m conquer the world  He opened his pouch to see what was left of his possessions  maybe there was a bit left of the sandwich he had eaten on the ship  the old man had given him  had exchanged six sheep for two precious stones that had been taken from a gold breastplate  He could sell the stones and buy a removing them from the pouch so he could put them in his pocket  him was that port towns are full of thieves  Now he understood why the owner of the bar had been so upset  he was trying to tell him not to trust that man  “ I ’ m like everyone not what actually does  ” temperature and feeling their surfaces  They were his treasure  Just handling them made him feel better  They reminded him of the old man  The boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man stones were proof that he had met with a king — a king who knew of the boy ’ s past  read the omens  ” The boy put the stones back in the pouch and decided to do an experiment  The old man had said to ask very clear he asked if the old man ’ s blessing was still with him  He took out one of the stones  It was “ yes  ” “ Am I going to find my treasure  ” he asked  pouch and fell to the ground  The boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch  He knelt down to find Urim and Thummim and put them back in the pouch  But as he saw them lying said  An omen  The boy smiled to himself  He picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch  He didn ’ t consider mending the hole — the stones could fall through any time they wanted  He so as not to flee from one ’ s own Personal Legend  “ I promised that I and that made him feel more confident  He looked around at the strange place  it was a new one  thought  Although his new world at the moment was just an empty and he would never forget it  He remembered the sword  It hurt him between thinking of himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an adventurer in quest of his treasure  HE WAS SHAKEN INTO WAKEFULNESS BY SOMEONE  HE had fallen asleep in resume  He no longer had to seek out food and water for the sheep  he could as much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books  He walked slowly through the market  The merchants were reminded the boy of the old man — the mysterious old king he had met  “ This candy merchant isn ’ t making candy so that later he can travel or marry a shopkeeper ’ s daughter  He ’ s doing it because it ’ s the same thing the old man had done — sense whether a person was near to or far from his Personal Legend  Just by looking at them  It ’ s spoken Arabic and the other Spanish  And they had understood each other perfectly well  it ’ s happening with people  He was learning a lot of new things  Some of them were things had never perceived before  And he hadn ’ t perceived them because he had become accustomed to them  He realized  If I can learn to the world  the narrow streets of Tangier  Only in that way would he be able to his sheep  that he felt every morning  He had been in the same place for thirty years  a shop at the top of a hilly street where few customers passed  Now it was too late to change anything — the only thing he had ever learned to do was to buy and sell crystal glassware  There had been a time when many people knew of his shop  Arab were always wellheeled  In those days it had been wonderful to be have beautiful women at his side as he grew older  on the hill  And no one was going to climb the hill just to browse through a few small shops  But the crystal merchant had no choice  He had lived thirty years to do anything else  He spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings practiced eyes of the crystal merchant could see that the boy had no lunch for a few minutes until the boy moved on  A CARD HANGING IN THE DOORWAY ANNOUNCED THAT several languages were spoken in the shop  The boy saw a man appear behind the counter  them  ” The man looked at him without responding  entered the shop and bought some crystal  merchant  laughed  requires me to feed a hungry person  ” “ Because the crystal was dirty  And both you and I needed to cleanse our minds of negative thoughts  ” “ I ’ d like you to work in my shop  Two customers came in today really don ’ t know what they ’ re saying  Just as I hadn ’ t realized that for so many years I had been speaking a language without words to my sheep  “ Do you want to go to work for me  ” the merchant asked  The merchant laughed  “ Even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year … even if you earned a good commission selling every are thousands of kilometers of desert between here and there  ” There was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the Pyramids  It was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy ’ s that moment  The merchant looked anxiously at the boy  All the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared  picked up his pouch  some sheep  ” PART TWO THE BOY HAD BEEN WORKING FOR THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT for almost a would make him happy  The merchant spent the entire day pieces and not to break anything  some money aside  That morning he had done some calculating  if whole year to be able to buy some sheep  who pass at the bottom of the hill  ” might have died if we had come upon a snake  But that ’ s the way life is with sheep and with shepherds  ” The merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses  He was selling better than ever … as if time had turned back to the old days when the street had been one of Tangier ’ s major attractions  return to your sheep  Why ask more out of life  ” the merchant had never met the king  said  But the merchant understood what the boy had said  The boy ’ s having hired the boy  The boy was being paid more money than he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep  away from the business of the display  saying nothing about his dream  The treasure was now nothing but “ I don ’ t know anyone around here who would want to cross the pile of stones  You could build one in your backyard  ” wait on a customer who had entered the shop  him much  But we two have to live with our mistakes  ” “ Why did you think we should have the display  ” “ I want to get back to my sheep faster  We have to take doing to help us  It ’ s called the principle of favorability  Or beginner ’ s luck  ” during our lives  The most important is to believe only in the one He stopped there  His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the wanted to live his life in accordance with Muslim law  “ What ’ s the fifth obligation  ” the boy asked  merchant answered  “ The fifth obligation of every Muslim is a holy city of Mecca  “ Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids  When I was leave someone in charge of the shop  the crystals are delicate things  pilgrimage were poorer than I  “ All who went there were happy at having done so  They placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses  One of tired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his leather  ” “ Because it ’ s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive  That ’ s on living  want to dream about Mecca  I ’ ve already imagined a thousand times seven times I walk around it before allowing myself to touch it  I ’ ve dream about it  ” display  Not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way  now able to speak their strange language  Since that morning in the because Egypt was now just as distant a dream for him as was disembark at Tarifa as a winner  words … and about omens  One afternoon he had seen a man at the “ Let ’ s sell tea to the people who climb the hill  ” “ But we could sell tea in crystal glasses  The people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses  I have been told that beauty is the great seducer of men  ” “ What is it you ’ re looking for  ” asked the old merchant  earn the money to do so  ” deeply  and everything else there is to know about crystal  I know its is going to expand  And then I ’ ll have to change my way of life  ” that it hasn ’ t been too bad  The shop is exactly the size I always know how to deal with change  I ’ m used to the way I am  ” didn ’ t see before  every blessing ignored becomes a curse  I don ’ t want anything else in life  But you are forcing me to look at wealth worse than I did before you arrived  Because I know the things I thought the boy to himself  They went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to himself for being able to do so  There had been a time when he thought that his sheep could teach him everything he needed to know about the world  But they could never have taught him Arabic  There are probably other things in the world that the sheep can ’ t “ What does that mean  ” answered  “ But in your language it would be something like ‘ It is written  ’ ” there ’ s just no way to hold back the river  the top  But there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing beautiful crystal glasses  would be impressed by the beauty of the glassware  The other man remarked that tea was always more delicious when it was served in tradition in the Orient to use crystal glasses for tea because it had magical powers  climb the hill to see the shop that was doing something new in a trade that was so old  Other shops were opened that served tea in business  and his shop was sought out by men and women with a thirst for things new  THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN  IT HAD BEEN ELEVEN months and nine days since he had first set foot on the African continent  especially for this day  He put his headcloth in place and secured it descended the stairs silently  The city was still sleeping  He prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass  Then he sat in the sunfilled sound of the wind that brought the scent of the desert  When he had It was a bundle of money  Enough to buy himself a hundred and Africa into his own country  He waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop  Then the two went off to have some more tea  my sheep  And you have the money you need to go to Mecca  ” The old man said nothing  “ Will you give me your blessing  ” asked the boy  “ You have Then he turned to the boy  crystal shop  But you know that I ’ m not going to go to Mecca  Just as you know that you ’ re not going to buy your sheep  ” And he gave the boy his blessing  THE BOY WENT TO HIS ROOM AND PACKED HIS BELONGINGS  They filled three and Thummim  realize how long it had been since he had thought of him  For nearly aside enough money so that he could return to Spain with pride  omens  ” strange sensation that the old king was nearby  He had worked hard thought  Even though the sheep didn ’ t teach me to speak Arabic  But the sheep had taught him something even more important  language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying for something believed in and desired  Tangier was no longer a could conquer the world  dreams are but don ’ t want to realize them  The old king hadn ’ t told could build one in his backyard  And he had forgotten to mention The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things  He went down the stairs and found the merchant waiting on a foreign tea from crystal glasses  It was more activity than usual for this time the old merchant ’ s hair was very much like the hair of the old king  had also been like the old king ’ s smile  trying to realize their Personal Legend  He left without saying goodbye to the crystal merchant  He didn ’ t want to cry with the other people there  He was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned  He was more the world  longer happy with his decision  He had worked for an entire year to becoming less important  Maybe because that wasn ’ t really his dream  Who knows … maybe it ’ s better to be like the crystal merchant  boy thought — he came to the bar he had entered on his first day tea  done  But maybe I ’ ll never have another chance to get to the an entire desert between him and the Pyramids  Yet the boy felt that there was another way to regard his situation  he was actually two hours closer to his treasure … the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn ’ t matter  all the time I need  Why not  He suddenly felt tremendously happy  He could always go back to being a shepherd  He could always become a crystal salesman anyone  He was planning as he left the bar  He had remembered that one of the crystal merchant ’ s suppliers transported his crystal by means of caravans that crossed the desert  He held Urim and Thummim in to his treasure  What could it cost to go over to the supplier ’ s warehouse and find out if the Pyramids were really that far away  THE ENGLISHMAN WAS SITTING ON A BENCH IN A STRUCTURE that smelled of and here I am in a corral  But he had to move on  He believed in omens  All his life and all his studies were aimed at finding the one true language of the but his studies had taken him to a point beyond which he could not seem to go  He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an Work — the Philosopher ’ s Stone — and for this reason kept their knowledge to themselves  He had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his had purchased all the rarest and most important volumes on alchemist had visited Europe  It was said that he was more than two Stone and the Elixir of Life  The Englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story  But he would never have thought it more archaeological expedition in the desert — told him about an Arab that was possessed of exceptional powers  transform any metal into gold  ” The Englishman could not contain his excitement  He canceled all his commitments and pulled together the most important of his thought  And the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable  greeted the Englishman  “ Where are you bound  ” asked the young Arab  his reading  He didn ’ t want any conversation at this point  What he the alchemist would certainly put him to the test  The young Arab took out a book and began to read  The book other important things to do  burial scene that began the book  “ I ’ ve been trying for two years to concentrate  He still had some doubts about the decision he had made  But he was able to understand one thing  making a decision was only the diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision  a mystery to me  off the conversation  The boy closed his book  He felt that he didn ’ t want to do anything that might make him look like the Englishman  He took In a flash the boy put them back in his pocket  the earth  But those who know about such things would know that those are Urim and Thummim  I didn ’ t know that they had them in this part of the world  ” “ Did you say a king  ” he asked  “ I guess you don ’ t believe that a king would talk to someone like “ Not at all  It was shepherds who were the first to recognize a surprising that kings would talk to shepherds  ” me about Urim and Thummim  These stones were the only form of divination permitted by God  The priests carried them in a golden breastplate  ” The boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse  “ Who told you about omens  ” The boy ’ s interest was increasing by the moment  have to find a man who knows that universal language  An alchemist  ” The conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss  leaving today for AlFayoum  ” you  ” about the words luck and coincidence  It ’ s with those words that the universal language is written  ” He told the boy it was no coincidence that he had met him with were in search of the alchemist  regretted having said it  But the Englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it  the warehouse boss called to them to come outside  hold the power of life and death for every person I take with me  crazy  ” belts and rifles slung on their shoulders  The Englishman had the leader had to repeat himself several times for everyone to understand what he was saying  will do everything possible once again to win out over the desert  But I want each and every one of you to swear by the God you believe in that you will follow my orders no matter what  In the There was a murmur from the crowd  Each was swearing quietly to his or her own God  The boy swore to Jesus Christ  The Englishman said nothing  And the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have  The people were also praying to heaven for protection  uncertainly onto their backs  The boy felt sorry for the Englishman ’ s picking up the conversation where it had been interrupted in the warehouse  “ I ’ m here because a friend of mine heard of an Arab who … ” what the Englishman was saying  The boy knew what he was about boy  The caravan moved toward the east  It traveled during the spent most of his time with his books  The boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert  Now everything was quite different from mixed with the nervous orders of the guides and the merchants  and of the hoofbeats of the animals  Even the guides spoke very little to one another  remain silent  ” seems old and wise  had sat at the fort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face  It reminded him of the wool from his sheep … his sheep who were always had  probably already forgotten me  That ’ s good  Creatures like the probably wasn ’ t the only one  But he was excited at his intuitive understanding of the camel driver ’ s comment  maybe he was also learning the universal language that deals with the past and the boy was beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden was covered with the salt of driedup lakes  The animals balked at unburden their charges  The drivers carried the freight themselves appoint a new one  But all this happened for one basic reason  no matter how many his books  first few days of the journey  But he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind  As soon as he had a superstition that each time he opened the book he would learn He became friendly with the camel driver who traveled to the driver his adventures as a shepherd  and that made me feel good  never to me  My neighbors feared they would lose all their olive children  I thought that everything I owned would be destroyed  living  So now I ’ m a camel driver  But that disaster taught me to understand the word of Allah  people need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want  our possessions and property  But this fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand  ” something that the other needed — as if everything were indeed the desert  were Bedouins who did surveillance along the caravan route  They provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes  They came fire where the Englishman and the boy were sitting  “ There are The three fell silent  The boy noted that there was a sense of fear experiencing the language without words … the universal language  The Englishman asked if they were in danger  including the danger  ” And he concluded by saying the mysterious word  “ Maktub  ” Englishman  “ Books are like caravans in that respect  ” The immense collection of people and animals began to travel when the travelers were accustomed to talking around the fires — attract attention to the caravan  The travelers adopted the practice of arranging the animals in a the nocturnal cold  And the leader posted armed sentinels at the fringes of the group  The Englishman was unable to sleep one night  He called to the Englishman the story of his life  The Englishman was fascinated with the part about the progress achieved at the crystal shop after the boy began working there  World  It ’ s always a positive force  ” animal — or even just a simple thought  rarely recognize that it is working for us  But in the crystal shop you probably realized that even the glasses were collaborating in your success  ” The boy thought about that for a while as he looked at the moon and the bleached sands  “ I have watched the caravan as it crossed “ If either of us had joined this caravan based only on personal would have been much more difficult  ” They stood there looking at the moon  speaks to the soul of the desert  ” caravan  ” that seemed to repeat itself throughout all the books  all things are the manifestation of one thing only  In one of the books he learned that the most important text in inscribed on the surface of an emerald  might teach something to the boy  The book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists  They were men who had dedicated their entire lives to the purification of metals in their laboratories  they believed World  This Soul of the World allowed them to understand anything things communicated  They called that discovery the Master Work — it was part liquid and part solid  “ Can ’ t you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language  ” the boy asked  has to be followed exactly as it was followed by the masters  ” The boy learned that the liquid part of the Master Work was alchemist from growing old  And the solid part was called the Philosopher ’ s Stone  observing the fire that purified the metals  They spent so much time close to the fire that gradually they gave up the vanities of the world  They discovered that the purification of the metals had led to a purification of themselves  ” The boy thought about the crystal merchant  He had said that it could free himself from negative thoughts  The boy was becoming more and more convinced that alchemy could be learned in one ’ s daily life  fascinating property  A small sliver of the stone can transform large quantities of metal into gold  ” transform everything into gold  He read the lives of the various and Geber  They were fascinating stories  each of them lived out his Philosopher ’ s Stone and the Elixir of Life  But when the boy wanted to learn how to achieve the Master “ WHY DO THEY MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED  ” HE asked the Englishman and missed his books  “ So that those who have the responsibility for understanding can transforming lead into gold  Gold would lose its value  middle of the desert  I ’ m seeking a true alchemist who will help me to decipher the codes  ” “ When were these books written  ” the boy asked  “ Many centuries ago  ” argued  “ There was no way for everybody to know about alchemy  The Englishman didn ’ t answer him directly  He said that for the past few days he had been paying attention to how the caravan he had noticed was that talk of war was becoming more and more frequent  THEN ONE DAY THE BOY RETURNED THE BOOKS TO THE Englishman  “ Did might be  He needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war  understands that soul can also understand the language of things  I they could be written on the surface of an emerald  ” magic the strange and the laboratory equipment … none of this had made an impression on the boy  His He took back his books and packed them away again in their bags  and the sand raised by the animals  “ Everyone has his or her own THE CARAVAN BEGAN TO TRAVEL DAY AND NIGHT  THE hooded Bedouins had become a good friend of the boy ’ s — explained that the war between the tribes had already begun  The caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis  themselves less and less  The silence was the worst aspect of the because it might signal a raid  the threat of war  “ Because I don ’ t live in either my past or my future  I ’ m interested only in the present  If you can concentrate always on the looked for the star they followed every night  He thought that the stars on the desert itself  “ Because we have to sleep  ” early  But the boy was quiet  He was at home with the silence of the would just be a memory  But this was the present moment — the party the camel driver had mentioned — and he wanted to live it as he did the lessons of his past and his dreams of the future  Although could herald a miracle  as he watched the hundreds of people and animals arriving at the excitement at the arrival of the strangers  The alchemist saw the at length  But none of that mattered to the alchemist  He had already seen had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands  The dunes sands he had known since he was a child  He always enjoyed seeing Maybe God created the desert so that man could appreciate the date He decided to concentrate on more practical matters  He knew that in the caravan there was a man to whom he was to teach some of his secrets  The omens had told him so  He didn ’ t know the man He hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice  I don ’ t know why these things have to be transmitted by word of revealed his secrets easily to all his creatures  He had only one explanation for this fact  things have to be and this kind of life cannot be captured in pictures or words  wind up forgetting the Language of the World  being just a well surrounded by a few palm trees — as he had seen once in a geography book — was much larger than many towns back and innumerable colored tents spread among them  impatient to meet with the alchemist  animals and people that were arriving  The men of the oasis wanted with one another for access to the cloth and precious stones brought by the merchants  The silence of the desert was a distant world and found themselves once again in the world of people  They were relieved and happy  camel driver explained to the boy that oases were always inhabitants were women and children  There were oases leaving the oases as places of refuge  people together and gave them his instructions  The group was to remain there at the oasis until the conflict between the tribes was accommodations  That was the law of hospitality  Then he asked the men appointed by the tribal chieftains  may not shelter armies or troops  ” revolver out of his bag and gave it to the men who were collecting the arms  “ Why a revolver  ” he asked  seemed as if what the old king had called “ beginner ’ s luck ” were no constantly subjected to tests of his persistence and courage  So he he would fail to see the signs and omens left by God along his path  God placed them along my path  He had surprised himself with job  He had never thought of them in terms of a language used by God to indicate what he should do  driver said  ‘ Eat when it ’ s time to eat  And move along when it ’ s time to move along  ’ ” tent with five other young men of about his age  They were people tell them of his experiences at the crystal shop when the Englishman came into the tent  outside  “ I need you to help me find out where the alchemist lives  ” probably live in a manner that was different from that of the rest of the oasis was much larger than they could have imagined  there were hundreds of tents  sitting down with the boy near one of the wells  The Englishman didn ’ t want to tell others about his reasons for The boy approached a woman who had come to the well to fill a goatskin with water  alchemist lives here at the oasis  ” because they were married women  He should respect tradition  The Englishman was disappointed  It seemed he had made the long journey for nothing  The boy was also saddened  his friend was that ’ s what the old king had said  He couldn ’ t have been wrong  The Englishman ’ s eyes lit up  “ That ’ s it  Maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is  Find out who it is who cures the people ’ s illnesses  ” insistence  Then a man approached  “ Do you know someone here who cures people ’ s illnesses  ” the boy asked  strangers  “ You ’ re looking for witch doctors  ” He spoke some verses bucket  The boy repeated his question  “ Why do you want to find that sort of person  ” the Arab asked  “ Because my friend here has traveled for many months in order the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to  Only when he consents  “ Wait for the end of the war  Then leave with the caravan  Don ’ t But the Englishman was exultant  They were on the right track  ask about the alchemist  Soul of the World surged within him  When he looked into her dark he learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke — the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart  It was love  Something older than crystals and in the silence of the desert  It was the pure Language of the World  It required no endless time  What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in than of anything in the world  He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person before becoming committed  But maybe people who felt that way under the sun has been written by one hand only  It is the hand that the same  “ What ’ s your name  ” he asked  “ That ’ s what some women in my country are called  ” invaders carried the name everywhere  ” The beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride  man who cured people ’ s illnesses  said  “ He communicates with the genies of the desert  ” The genies were the spirits of good and evil  And the girl pointed she filled her vessel with water and left  day in Tarifa the levanter had brought to him the perfume of that she existed  He knew that his love for her would enable him to discover every treasure in the world  asked me if I had ever transformed lead into gold  I told him that was what I had come here to learn  “ He told me I should try to do so  That ’ s all he said  ‘ Go and try  ’ ” The boy didn ’ t say anything  The poor Englishman had traveled already done so many times  “ That ’ s what I ’ m going to do  I ’ m going to start now  ” water  my wife  I love you  ” “ I ’ m going to wait here for you every day  I have crossed the it brought me to you  ” The boy looked around him at the date palms  He reminded shepherd again  Fatima was more important than his treasure  if she had guessed what he was thinking  “ And the women of the desert are proud of their tribesmen  ” She refilled her vessel and left  The boy went to the well every day to meet with Fatima  He told of the caravan called a meeting of all of the people traveling with him  important to both armies  It ’ s not a battle of good against evil  It ’ s a Allah is on both sides  ” went to meet with Fatima that afternoon  He told her about the become a part of you  ” more beautiful than the sound of the wind in the date palms  “ I have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time  I which men of the desert expect women to behave  Ever since I was a The boy wanted to take her hand  But Fatima ’ s hands held to the handles of her jug  it  “ That ’ s why I want you to continue toward your goal  If you have our love for each other  come back one day  ” The boy was sad as he left her that day  He thought of all the married shepherds he had known  They had a difficult time convincing their wives that they had to go off into distant fields  Love required them to stay with the people they loved  hide in the ravines and of the water that comes from the earth  They become a part of everything … they become the Soul of the World  “ Some do come back  And then the other women are happy too will be one of the women who wait  The boy went to look for the Englishman  He wanted to tell him about Fatima  He was surprised when he saw that the Englishman they had when he was reading his books  was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the Master But I ’ m happy at least that I didn ’ t wait twenty years  ” desert turned pink in the setting sun  He felt the urge to go out into to become hypnotized by the horizon  He tried to deal with the He watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind  Although sense to the boy  It was just that he couldn ’ t grasp what it meant  He it  Maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership  everything in the world is beginning to make sense to me … even the materialized over the sands of the desert  But he certainly didn ’ t desire that an army invade the oasis  meditation  He tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the that wouldn ’ t allow him to do so  to occur  dangerous  observing the sunset  He saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes  answered  But the boy told him about the hawks  that he had been watching their flight and had suddenly felt himself to have plunged to the Soul of the World  The camel driver understood what the boy was saying  He knew that any given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history means of penetration to the Soul of the World  The desert was full of men who earned their living based on the ease with which they could penetrate to the Soul of the World  They would be impossible to be effective in battle if one knew that he was thrill of not knowing what the outcome would be  the future was of many things  Where was the enemy ’ s sword  Where was his horse  What kind of blow should one deliver next in order to consulted with seers  Many of them had been right about what they had ever sought out  and the one most to be feared  had asked why the camel driver was so interested in the future  change those things that I don ’ t want to happen  ” said  myself for what ’ s coming  ” greatly before they even occur  ” driver had said to the seer  “ And men always live their lives based on the future  ” The seer was a specialist in the casting of twigs  he threw them cloth and put them back in his bag  omens that are here in the present  guess at the future  Based on the omens of the present  The secret is The camel driver had asked what the circumstances were under which God would allow him to see the future  that was written so as to be altered  ” thought  Why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument  “ Tell them about the armies that are approaching  ” “ They ’ ll laugh at me  ” to dealing with omens  ” “ They ’ re not concerned with that right now  They believe that if someone will tell them about it  It has happened many times before  The boy thought of Fatima  And he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes  THE BOY APPROACHED THE GUARD AT THE FRONT OF THE huge white tent at the center of the oasis  “ I want to see the chieftains  I ’ ve brought omens from the desert  ” into the tent  conversation with her  boy was astonished by what he saw inside  Never could he have like this one  The ground was covered with the most beautiful resting upon richly embroidered silk cushions  Servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea  Other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs  The atmosphere was suffused with the sweet scent of smoke  which of them was the most important  an Arab dressed in white young Arab the boy had spoken with earlier  “ Who is this stranger who speaks of omens  ” asked one of the knows that we have been here for generations  ” said another of the chieftains  said  “ I can see things that eyes habituated to the desert might not see  ” to himself  third chieftain  you don ’ t have to do anything about it  ” The men fell into an animated discussion  They spoke in an told him that something was wrong  He regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert  and the boy felt better  The man hadn ’ t participated in the feel the vibrations of peace throughout the tent  Now his intuition was that he had been right in coming  The discussion ended  The chieftains were silent for a few moments as they listened to what the old man was saying  Then he turned to the boy  this time his expression was cold and distant  know that whoever believes in dreams also knows how to interpret them  ” “ We always observe the Tradition  The Tradition saved Egypt how their children should marry  The Tradition says that an oasis is vulnerable  ” No one said a word as the old man continued  “ But the Tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert  Everything we know was taught to us by the desert  ” again  no one at the oasis may carry arms  Throughout the entire day we will once again surrender their arms to me  For every ten dead men “ But arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle  Arms time they might not function  If at least one of them hasn ’ t been began to make his way there  He was alarmed by what had happened  He had succeeded in having done so might be his life  It was a frightening bet  But he had been making risky bets ever since the day he had sold his sheep to die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day  Every day was there to be lived or to mark one ’ s departure from this world  Everything depended on one word  “ Maktub  ” silence of the desert and Fatima ’ s eyes  He had lived every one of his days intensely since he had left home so long ago  If he died and he was proud of that  the ground by a wind such as he had never known  The area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view  Before frightening scream  what he saw  Astride the animal was a horseman dressed with a black kerchief  He appeared to be a messenger from the mere messenger  scabbard mounted on his saddle  The steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon  “ Who dares to read the meaning of the flight of the hawks  ” he fifty thousand palm trees of AlFayoum  except that now the roles were reversed  I was able to see through to the Soul of the World  ” until the point touched the boy ’ s forehead  It drew a droplet of blood  sense of joy  he was about to die in pursuit of his Personal Legend  that Soul  The stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy ’ s forehead  “ Why did you read the flight of the birds  ” “ I read only what the birds wanted to tell me  They wanted to men at the oasis than you have  ” The sword remained where it was  “ Who are you to change what Allah has willed  ” taught me the language of the birds  Everything has been written by words  the boy felt immensely relieved  But he still couldn ’ t flee  of the battle  ” The stranger seemed satisfied with the answer  But he kept the sword in his hand  “ What is a stranger doing in a strange land  ” “ I am following my Personal Legend  It ’ s not something you would understand  ” relaxed  quality most essential to understanding the Language of the World  ” The boy was surprised  The stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about  those who become distracted  ” What he said reminded the boy of the old king  The same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip  away  The hand with the whip pointed to the south  The boy had met the alchemist  throughout the palm trees at AlFayoum  Before the sun had horizon  The mounted troops entered the oasis from the north  it hidden in their robes  When they reached the white tent at the they attacked an empty tent  The men of the oasis surrounded the horsemen from the desert and within half an hour all but one of the intruders were dead  The and saw nothing of what had happened  The women had remained The only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion  asked him why he had violated the Tradition  The commander said return to the war  that the Tradition was sacred  He condemned the commander to desert wind  asked the boy to become the counselor of the oasis  and a group of Arabs passing by told the boy that it was a place inhabited by genies  But the boy sat down and waited  Not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view  He carried two dead hawks over his shoulder  Personal Legend that brings you here  ” desert  So I have come here  ” boy should enter the tent with him  It was a tent like many at the oasis  The boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus mysterious designs  said the alchemist  The boy suspected that they were the same hawks he had seen scent of the hookahs  “ Why did you want to see me  ” the boy asked  Englishman  He ’ s the one that ’ s looking for you  ” “ He has other things to do first  But he ’ s on the right track  He has begun to try to understand the desert  ” “ And what about me  ” Another person was there to help him toward his Personal Legend  “ So you are going to instruct me  ” “ No  You already know all you need to know  I am only going to point you in the direction of your treasure  ” “ I know what ’ s happening in the desert  ” “ I also have Fatima  She is a treasure greater than anything else I have won  ” They ate in silence  The alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy ’ s cup  It was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted  “ Isn ’ t wine prohibited here  ” the boy asked alchemist  “ It ’ s what comes out of their mouths that is  ” under a moon so brilliant that it made the stars pale  everything you have learned along the way can make sense  traitorous  they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire  they are about to die  ” where there is life out in the desert  Only those who can see such signs of life are able to find treasure  ” thought  I don ’ t know the desert that well yet  man  They reached the rocky place where the boy had seen the And then the boy understood  He loosened the reins on his followed as the boy ’ s horse ran for almost half an hour  They could no longer see the palms of the oasis — only the gigantic moon above alchemist ’ s eyes — the boy could see only his eyes — squinted with his effort  His arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the minutes  with the snakes of the desert  The boy watched as his companion went to his horse and then he placed the snake within it  The serpent relaxed immediately  “ Why was that so important  ” “ Because the Pyramids are surrounded by the desert  ” The boy didn ’ t want to talk about the Pyramids  His heart was continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon Fatima  treasure  ” knows that men have to go away in order to return  And she already has her treasure  it ’ s you  Now she expects that you will find what it is you ’ re looking for  ” “ Let me tell you what will happen  You ’ ll be the counselor of the oasis  You have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels  how the world is always changing  And you ’ ll get better and better there is  try to ignore them  You ’ ll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants  The tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do  And your camels will bring you wealth and power  she ’ ll return your love  You ’ ll remember that she never asked you to man  So you won ’ t blame her  But many times you ’ ll walk the sands could have trusted more in your love for Fatima  Because what kept you at the oasis was your own fear that you might never come back  forever  and a great deal of merchandise  You ’ ll spend the rest of your days it ’ s too late  “ You must understand that love never keeps a man from because it wasn ’ t true love … the love that speaks the Language of the World  ” slithered away among the rocks  The boy remembered the crystal Englishman in search of the alchemist  He thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert  And he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved  followed the alchemist back to the oasis  The wind brought the strange horseman with the falcon on his shoulder had spoken of Legend  in his heart  response  friend enough gold to buy a sheep  Then he asked his friend to go into the tent where Fatima was buy yet another sheep  sheep  Fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent  The two walked out among the palms  The boy knew that it was a violation of the coming back  I love you because … ” one is loved  No reason is needed for loving  ” the entire universe conspired to help me find you  ” The two embraced  It was the first time either had touched the other  then  ” They said nothing else  They walked a bit farther among the said  He saw that Fatima ’ s eyes were filled with tears  “ You ’ re crying  ” out to do the chores she had done for years  But everything had never again have the same meaning it had had only yesterday  It would no longer be a place with fifty thousand palm trees and three place for her  boy was following in search of his treasure  She would have to send the hope for his return  the boy as they began to ride across the sands of the desert  forever  ” boy said  He was already reaccustomed to the desert ’ s silence  one can always come back  If what you had found was only a on your return  ” The man was speaking the language of alchemy  But the boy knew that he was referring to Fatima  It was difficult not to think about what he had left behind  The camel driver who was a teacher without realizing it  Maybe the speaking only of the precautions they needed to follow in order to failed to observe  offered his water container to the boy  “ I congratulate you for having pursued your Personal Legend  ” thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know  A alchemy  But I wasn ’ t able to learn anything from them  ” through action  Everything you need to know you have learned through your journey  You need to learn only one thing more  ” “ Why are you called the alchemist  ” “ Because that ’ s what I am  ” “ And what went wrong when other alchemists tried to make gold and were unable to do so  ” wanting actually to live out the Personal Legend  ” “ What is it that I still need to know  ” the boy asked  But the alchemist continued to look to the horizon  And finally the falcon returned with their meal  They dug a hole and lit their fire feel that they knew a better way than others had  Yet the Emerald Tablet is still alive today  ” “ What was written on the Emerald Tablet  ” the boy wanted to know  as if it had taken place years and years ago  The boy tried to read what was written in the sand  saw in the Englishman ’ s books  ” hawks  it can ’ t be understood by reason alone  The Emerald Tablet is a direct passage to the Soul of the World  “ The wise men understood that this natural world is only an image and a copy of paradise  The existence of this world is simply a guarantee that there exists a world that is perfect  God created the spiritual teachings and the marvels of his wisdom  That ’ s what I mean by action  ” “ Should I understand the Emerald Tablet  ” the boy asked  the right time to study the best way to understand the Emerald Tablet  But you are in the desert  So immerse yourself in it  The on the face of the earth will do that  You don ’ t even have to understand the desert  all you have to do is contemplate a simple “ How do I immerse myself in the desert  ” THEY CROSSED THE DESERT FOR ANOTHER TWO DAYS IN silence  The approaching the area where the most violent battles were being times it became so emotional over the desert sunrise that the boy had to hide his tears  His heart beat fastest when it spoke to the boy when the boy and the alchemist had fallen into silence  they had made camp that day  treasure  ” when I ’ m thinking about her  ” has to say  ” boy ’ s heart began to speak of fear  It told him stories it had heard treasure and never succeeded  Sometimes it frightened the boy with satisfied  it had found love and riches  had paused to rest the horses  “ It doesn ’ t want me to go on  ” you ’ ve won  ” “ Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet  Even if and about the world  ” “ Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly  If you know your “ You will never be able to escape from your heart  So it ’ s better unanticipated blow  ” The boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the suffer terribly  ” alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky  “ Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself  And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in second ’ s encounter with God and with eternity  ” was a part of the dream that I would find it  When I have been truly I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that seemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve  ” things that came from the Soul of the World  It said that all people who are happy have God within them  And that happiness could be has taken millions of years to create it  “ Everyone on earth has a want to go in search of them  We speak of them only to children  we don ’ t want people to suffer because they don ’ t follow their hearts  ” “ Why don ’ t people ’ s hearts tell them to continue to follow their dreams  ” the boy asked the alchemist  like to suffer  ” message  understood that the boy ’ s heart had returned to the Soul of the World  “ So what should I do now  ” the boy asked  “ And continue to pay heed to the omens  Your heart is still capable of showing you where the treasure is  ” “ Is that the one thing I still needed to know  ” everything that was learned along the way  It does this not because master the lessons we ’ ve learned as we ’ ve moved toward that dream  That ’ s the point at which most people give up  It ’ s the point just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon  ’ “ Every search begins with beginner ’ s luck  And every search ends with the victor ’ s being severely tested  ” The boy remembered an old proverb from his country  It said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn  the alchemist were doing there  “ We ’ re going to have to search you to see whether you ’ re had searched the boy ’ s bag  The tribesman who was searching the alchemist ’ s belongings that was slightly larger than a chicken ’ s egg  “ What are these things  ” he asked  “ That ’ s the Philosopher ’ s Stone and the Elixir of Life  It ’ s the Master Work of the alchemists  Whoever swallows that elixir will into gold  ” alchemist to proceed with all of their belongings  moved on  “ What did you do that for  ” the boy ’ s heart became more and more silent  It no longer wanted to know about things of the past or future  it was content simply to was capable now of betraying the other  the desert were wearisome  His heart told the boy what his strongest qualities were  his courage in having given up his sheep during the time he had worked at the crystal shop  And his heart told him something else that the boy had never he had never perceived  His heart said that one time it had hidden that the boy might wound himself  And it reminded the boy of the he had fallen into a deep sleep  There had been two thieves farther ahead who were planning to steal the boy ’ s sheep and murder him  thinking that he had changed his route  “ Does a man ’ s heart always help him  ” the boy asked the alchemist  “ Mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their “ Does that mean that I ’ ll never run into danger  ” said  tribes  At each corner of the camp were Arabs garbed in beautiful hookahs and trading stories from the battlefield  No one paid any attention to the two travelers  the encampment  forget that you ’ re in the desert  When men are at war with one one fails to suffer the consequences of everything under the sun  ” appeared from behind the travelers  where the tribes are at war  ” straight into the eyes of the horsemen  They were silent for a move along  The boy watched the exchange with fascination  “ You dominated alchemist  been one who stared fixedly at the two  He had been so far away that his face wasn ’ t even visible  But the boy was certain that he had been looking at them  only two days from the Pyramids  teach me about alchemy  ” “ You already know about alchemy  It is about penetrating to the reserved for you  ” into gold  ” only after they had stopped to eat  don ’ t know why  I just know that the Tradition is always right  conflict  ” But then he stopped  The alchemist probably already knew all that  thing evolves as well  “ Others stumbled upon the stone by accident  They already had of others  But they don ’ t count  They ’ re quite rare  iron have their own Personal Legends to fulfill  And anyone who interferes with the Personal Legend of another thing never will discover his own  ” The alchemist ’ s words echoed out like a curse  He reached over and picked up a shell from the ground  The alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear  He had of the sea  Legend  And it will never cease doing so until the desert is once again covered by water  ” Pyramids of Egypt  THE SUN WAS SETTING WHEN THE BOY ’ S HEART SOUNDED a danger signal  alchemist to see whether he had sensed anything  But he appeared horsemen waiting ahead of them  Before he could say anything to hundred  And then they were everywhere in the dunes  surrounding their turbans  Their faces were hidden behind blue souls  And their eyes spoke of death  THE TWO WERE TAKEN TO A NEARBY MILITARY CAMP  A soldier shoved the boy and the alchemist into a tent where the chief was holding a meeting with his staff  “ You were seen at the enemy camp three days ago  And you were talking with one of the troops there  ” said the alchemist  “ I have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes  I was simply acting as a guide for my friend here  ” “ Who is your friend  ” the chief asked  nature  And he wants to show you his extraordinary powers  ” The boy listened quietly  And fearfully  “ What is a foreigner doing here  ” asked another of the men  alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief  The Arab accepted them without a word  There was enough there to buy a lot of weapons  “ It ’ s a man who understands nature and the world  If he wanted knew that the wind could not deliver them a fatal blow  Yet each felt were fearful of sorcerers  tribe  ” of the tent  But the boy couldn ’ t even speak  He was able to do so only after they had walked through the center of the camp  There was no need an impenetrable wall  “ You gave them everything I had  ” the boy said  “ Everything I ’ ve saved in my entire life  ” alchemist answered  “ Your money saved us for three days  It ’ s not often that money saves a person ’ s life  ” But the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom  He had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind  He wasn ’ t an alchemist  alchemist muttered some words that the boy didn ’ t understand  “ But I have no idea how to turn myself into the wind  ” everything he needs to know  There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve  the fear of failure  ” “ I ’ m not afraid of failing  It ’ s just that I don ’ t know how to turn myself into the wind  ” “ But what if I can ’ t  ” “ Then you ’ ll die in the midst of trying to realize your Personal who never even knew what their Personal Legends were  of death makes people a lot more aware of their lives  ” number of wounded were brought back to the camp  The dead of his companions  “ You could have died after peace had been who had taken his falcon out into the desert  repeated  “ Remember what I told you  the world is only the visible aspect of God  And that what alchemy does is to bring spiritual perfection into contact with the material plane  ” “ What are you doing  ” “ Feeding my falcon  ” the boy said  “ Why feed your falcon  ” know how to turn myself into the wind  ” camp  The sentinels allowed him to go  they had already heard He spent the entire afternoon of the second day looking out over sensed his fear  They both spoke the same language  himself into the wind  ” The boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day  He told them all to be seated  desert  ” The boy looked out at the horizon  There were mountains in the living where survival seemed impossible  There was the desert that palm trees and three hundred wells  “ What do you want here today  ” the desert asked him  “ Didn ’ t you spend enough time looking at me yesterday  ” the wind  ” “ What is love  ” the desert asked  generous to him  ” answered  “ To nourish the falcon  And the falcon then nourishes will once again flourish  That ’ s how the world goes  ” “ So is that what love is  ” “ But you can at least understand that somewhere in your sands there is a woman waiting for me  And that ’ s why I have to turn myself into the wind  ” The desert didn ’ t answer him for a few moments  wind  ” A breeze began to blow  The tribesmen watched the boy from a couldn ’ t understand  The alchemist smiled  The wind approached the boy and touched his face  It knew of to die  loved one to me  ” “ Who taught you to speak the language of the desert and the wind  ” things  ” I love  ” “ I heard what you were talking about the other day with the Personal Legend  But people can ’ t turn themselves into the wind  ” “ So you and I can talk about the limitless possibilities of people and the winds  ” know how to turn a man into the wind  And look how many things that there were other things the wind should be able to do  wind  And it knew nothing about love  having to acknowledge its own limitations  “ Maybe it ’ s better to ask heaven  ” sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun  Then I can look to heaven without blinding myself  ” sand  The sun was turned into a golden disk  desert were already familiar with that wind  They called it the and all their weapons were filled with sand  They could barely see the boy  Their faces were covered with the “ I want to see how a man turns himself into the wind  ” But he made a mental note of the names of the two men who had are not afraid  grow and the sheep to seek out shade  From where I am — and I ’ m a long way from the earth — I learned how to love  I know that if I and the Soul of the World would no longer exist  So we contemplate and it gives me my reason for living  ” great length to each other during this endless trip through the only the minerals and vegetables understand that all things are one  the same as gold  Each performs its own exact function as a unique that wrote all this had stopped on the fifth day of creation  the boy said  “ But you don ’ t know about love  If there hadn ’ t been a but one day that Personal Legend will be realized  So each thing has thing only  ” was in his former life  Lead will play its role until the world has no further need for lead  and then lead will have to turn itself into gold  too  ” asked the boy  roam the world like the wind  And it ’ s not love to see everything become better or worse  And that ’ s where the power of love comes we are  ” “ So what do you want of me  ” the sun asked  answered  “ But I don ’ t know how to turn you into the wind  ” and wanted to tell every corner of the world that the sun ’ s wisdom had its limitations  That it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the Language of the World  each other as they sought to keep from being blown away  speak  prayer without words or pleas  His prayer didn ’ t give thanks for his sheep having found new pastures  it didn ’ t ask that the boy be able to sell more crystal  and it didn ’ t beseech that the woman he had single emerald  He saw that omens were scattered throughout the man into the wind  Because only the hand understood that it was a larger design that had moved the universe to the point at which six days of creation had evolved into a Master Work  it was a part of the Soul of God  And he saw that the Soul of God was THE SIMUM BLEW THAT DAY AS IT HAD NEVER BLOWN before  For where the boy had been  But he was no longer there  he was camp  The men were terrified at his sorcery  But there were two the glory of God  them as far as they chose  the escorts they could return to the camp  only three hours from the Pyramids  ” World  ” “ I only invoked what you already knew  ” The alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery  A monk dressed in black came to the gates  They spoke for a few minutes in smiled  They went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery  The which the alchemist placed in an iron pan  When the lead had and added it to the pan in which the lead had melted  The monk was irritated  The caravans had been stopped at Giza the monk said  longer lead  It was gold  “ Will I learn to do that someday  ” the boy asked  answered  “ But I wanted to show you that it was possible  ” alchemist separated the disk into four parts  monk  “ It ’ s for your generosity to the pilgrims  ” responded  the next time  ” The alchemist turned to the boy  “ This is for you  To make up for what you gave to the general  ” The boy was about to say that it was much more than he had alchemist said to the monk  He took the fourth part and handed it to the monk  “ This is for the boy  If he ever needs it  ” close to it now  ” “ Then why this  ” “ Because you have already lost your savings twice  Once to the happens once can never happen again  But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time  ’ ” They mounted their horses  The boy brought his horse closer  sent to the most distant regions of the empire  The other son was a and told him that the words of one of his sons would be learned and repeated throughout the world for all generations to come  The proud to know  who was about to be crushed by the wheels of a chariot  Since he in his dream  any wish you desire  ’ son ’ s poems will be read by men for generations to come  I don ’ t want anything for myself  But any father would be proud of the to see my son ’ s words  ’ surrounded by thousands of people speaking a strange language  “ The man wept with happiness  angel through his tears  ‘ Can you please tell me which of my son ’ s poems these people are repeating  ’ “ ‘ The verses of your son who was the poet were very popular in words you ’ re hearing now are those of your son in the military  ’ “ The man looked at the angel in surprise  he was seeking was the Son of God  He met others who had been where the man he was looking for was visiting  ’ rabbi made ready to go to his house with him  But the centurion was he was surely in the presence of the Son of God  ’ under my roof  But only speak a word and my servant will be healed  ” ” ’ earth plays a central role in the history of the world  And normally he doesn ’ t know it  ” The boy smiled  He had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd  avidly to what his heart had to say  It was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden  alchemist had told him  story of a shepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had many men who had wandered in search of distant lands or beautiful change  “ Be aware of the place where you are brought to tears  That ’ s where The boy climbed the dune slowly  A full moon rose again in the starry sky  it had been a month since he had set forth from the oasis  appearance of a rolling sea  it reminded the boy of the day when journey in search of treasure  illuminated by the light of the moon and the brightness of the The boy fell to his knees and wept  He thanked God for making for his having met a woman of the desert who had told him that love would never keep a man from his Personal Legend  He didn ’ t need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone  The everything he might have dreamed of  reminded himself that no project is completed until its objective has he thought of what the crystal merchant had once said  that anyone could build a pyramid in his backyard  The boy could see now that he couldn ’ t do so if he placed stone upon stone for the rest of his life  but found nothing  He felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the Pyramids had been built  But he didn ’ t stop  He struggled sand back into the excavation  His hands were abraded and his tears fell  heard footsteps  Several figures approached him  Their backs were faces  “ What are you doing here  ” one of the figures demanded  other figure said  “ What are you hiding there  ” But one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the gold  in the man ’ s eyes the boy saw death  “ He ’ s probably got more gold hidden in the ground  ” near  “ What good is money to you if you ’ re going to die  It ’ s not often that he had twice dreamed of a treasure hidden near the Pyramids of Egypt  The man who appeared to be the leader of the group spoke to one of the others  “ Leave him  He doesn ’ t have anything else  He must have stolen this gold  ” look for a ruined church where shepherds and their sheep slept  In would find a hidden treasure  But I ’ m not so stupid as to cross an entire desert just because of a recurrent dream  ” And they disappeared  heart bursting with joy  Because now he knew where his treasure was  EPILOGUE could still be seen through the halfdestroyed roof  He remembered the time he had been there with his sheep  it had been a peaceful night … except for the dream  He sat looking at the sky for a long time  Then he took from his looked at the stars and drank wine together  He thought of the many show him his treasure  If he hadn ’ t believed in the significance of himself  began to dig at the base of the sycamore  whole story  You even left a bit of gold at the monastery so I could get back to this church  The monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters  Couldn ’ t you have saved me from that  ” with jewels  The spoils of a conquest that the country had long ago about  The boy took out Urim and Thummim from his bag  He had used marketplace  His life and his path had always provided him with enough omens  He placed Urim and Thummim in the chest  They were also a It ’ s true  life really is generous to those who pursue their to get to Tarifa so he could give onetenth of his treasure to the he thought  Maybe it was because they moved around so much  The boy smiled  It was the first time she had done that  ABOUT THE AUTHOR he now lives  His own life has in many ways been as varied and unusual as the protagonists of his

ALCHEMIST PAULO COELHO TRANSLATED BY ALAN R . CLARKE Contents INTRODUCTION I remember receiving a letter from the American publisher Harper Collins … PROLOGUE The alchemist picked up a book that someone in the … ONE The boy ’ s name was Santiago . Dusk was falling as the … TWO The boy had been working for the crystal merchant for … EPILOGUE church just as night … ABOUT THE AUTHOR INTERNATIONAL ACCLAIM BOOKS BY PAULO COELHO CREDITS COVER COPYRIGHT ABOUT THE PUBLISHER TEN YEARS ON I REMEMBER RECEIVING A LETTER FROM THE AMERICAN publisher Harper Collins that said that : “ reading The Alchemist was like getting up at dawn and seeing the sun rise while the rest of the world still slept . ” I struggling to establish myself as a writer and to follow my path despite all the voices telling me it was impossible . Brazilian journalist phoned to say that President Clinton had been Roberts declaring that she adored the book . Walking alone down a The Alchemist ! ” What ’ s the secret behind such a huge success ? that God chose for you here on Earth . Whenever we do something we don ’ t all have the courage to confront our own dream . Why ? There are four obstacles . First : we are told from childhood onward that everything we want to do is impossible . We grow up calling is so deeply buried in our soul as to be invisible . But it ’ s still there . afraid of hurting those around us by abandoning everything in order to pursue our dream . We do not realize that love is just a We do not realize that those who genuinely wish us well want us to be happy and are prepared to accompany us on that journey . against the third obstacle : fear of the defeats we will meet on the didn ’ t really want it anyway . ” We do want it and know that we have staked everything on it and that the path of the personal calling is patience in difficult times and to know that the Universe is I ask myself : are defeats necessary ? up eight times . only going to suffer more than other people ? do — we are filled by a greater sense of euphoria and confidence . In unexpected suffering passes more quickly than suffering that is to free ourselves from the bitterness and it stays with us for the rest of our lives . the very next day . Then comes the fourth obstacle : the fear of realizing the dream for which we fought all our lives . Oscar Wilde said : “ Each man kills the thing he loves . ” And it ’ s true . The mere possibility of getting what we want fills the soul of the ordinary person with guilt . We look around at all those who have failed to get what they want and feel that we do not deserve to get what we want either . We forget about all the obstacles we series of stupid mistakes and never reached their goal — when it was only a step away . This is the most dangerous of the obstacles because it has a kind of saintly aura about it : renouncing joy and conquest . But if you and you understand why you are here .

Landers THE ALCHEMIST PICKED UP A BOOK THAT SOMEONE IN THE caravan had Narcissus . daily beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty . He was so called the narcissus . But this was not how the author of the book ended the story . transformed into a lake of salty tears . “ Why do you weep ? ” the goddesses asked . contemplate his beauty close at hand . ” “ But … was Narcissus beautiful ? ” the lake asked . “ Who better than you to know that ? ” the goddesses said in contemplate himself ! ” PART ONE THE BOY ’ S NAME WAS SANTIAGO . DUSK WAS FALLING AS the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church . The roof had fallen in long sacristy had once stood . He decided to spend the night there . He saw to it that all the across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night . searching for it . he had just finished reading as a pillow . He told himself that he made more comfortable pillows . the stars through the half-destroyed roof . before it ended . animals also began to stir . It was as if some mysterious energy could be the other way around : that it was he who had become accustomed to their schedule . But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken . name . He had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said . So there were times when he read them would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in the fields . Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed . But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one they would reach in about four days . He had been to the village only until the afternoon . So the boy sat on the steps of the shop and took a book from his bag . behind him . each day was like all the others . The shepherd told her of the where he had stopped . It was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep . “ How did you learn to read ? ” the girl asked at one point . The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question . He was sure the girl would never days . He recognized that he was feeling something he had never experienced before : the desire to live in one place forever . With the four sheep . He paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year . AND NOW IT WAS ONLY FOUR DAYS BEFORE HE WOULD BE back in that same selling their wool . other places . ” But in his heart he knew that it did matter . And he knew that town where there was someone who could make them forget the joys of carefree wandering . thought . Maybe that ’ s why they always stay close to me . The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water . seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk ; and they had the boy told them about the sights of the cities . They were content nourishment . him to feel anger toward his faithful companions . He drank a bit and he gathered his jacket closer to his body . He knew that a few great that he would not be able to lead his flock across the fields . It was the time of day when all of Spain slept during the summer . The jacket . But when he thought to complain about the burden of its withstood the cold of the dawn . grateful for the jacket ’ s weight and warmth . explain to the girl how it was that a simple shepherd knew how to read . That he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen . His pride for a simple farm family . They worked hard just to have food didn ’ t want to become a priest . That he wanted to travel . they leave they are basically the same people they were when they thinking that the past was better than what we have now . They have who live right here . ” boy explained . son . who travel are the shepherds . ” that held three ancient Spanish gold coins . “ I found these one day in the fields . I wanted them to be a part of women are the most beautiful . ” And he gave the boy his blessing . The boy could see in his happy ; he had already seen many castles and met many women ( but none the equal of the one who awaited him several days hence ) . He through those parts many times . The world was huge and inexhaustible ; he had only to allow his sheep to set the route for a is that they don ’ t even realize that they ’ re walking a new road every day . They don ’ t see that the fields are new and the seasons change . All they think about is food and water . thought of other women since I met the merchant ’ s daughter . had arrived there before him and asked for her hand . It ’ s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life there was an old woman who interpreted dreams . THE OLD WOMAN LED THE BOY TO A ROOM AT THE BACK of her house ; it was separated from her living room by a curtain of colored beads . The It sounded like a Gypsy prayer . The boy had already had had no flocks of sheep . People said that Gypsies spent their lives always been frightened to death that he would be captured by his hands in hers . showing the old woman that he was fearful . He recited an Our Father silently . the woman sensed it . He quickly pulled his hands away . regretting having come . He thought for a moment that it would be giving too much importance to his recurrent dream . old woman . “ And dreams are the language of God . When he speaks and that ’ s what makes a shepherd ’ s life exciting . sheep are afraid of strangers . But children always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them . I don ’ t know why . I don ’ t know how animals know the age of human beings . ” give you a lot of time . ” both hands and transported me to the Egyptian pyramids . ” He paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the Egyptian pyramids were . But she said nothing . times . ” The woman was silent for some time . Then she again took his hands and studied them carefully . The boy laughed — out of happiness . He was going to be able to save the little money he had because of a dream about hidden treasure ! your treasure in exchange for what I am going to tell you . ” The shepherd swore that he would . The old woman asked him to swear again while looking at the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus . that I deserve a part of what you find . “ And this is my interpretation : you must go to the Pyramids in you a rich man . ” out the old woman for this ! But then he remembered that he wasn ’ t going to have to pay anything . “ I told you that your dream was a difficult one . It ’ s the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary ; only wise men are “ I only interpret dreams . I don ’ t know how to turn them into reality . That ’ s why I have to live off what my daughters provide me with . ” “ And what if I never get to Egypt ? ” “ Then I don ’ t get paid . It wouldn ’ t be the first time . ” wasted too much time with him . So the boy was disappointed ; he decided that he would never again believe in dreams . He remembered that he had a number of things he had to take care of : he went to the market for something bench in the plaza where he could sample the new wine he had The boy knew a lot of people in the city . That was what made need to spend all of his time with them . When someone sees the they wind up becoming a part of that person ’ s life . And then they want the person to change . If someone isn ’ t what others want them her own . He decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky before following his flock back through the fields . Three days from He started to read the book he had bought . On the very first page it described a burial ceremony . And the names of the people reader wouldn ’ t have to worry about memorizing a lot of names . down at his side and tried to strike up a conversation . in the plaza . wanted to concentrate on his reading . who was capable of doing difficult things . He had already imagined he explained that the sheep had to be sheared from back to front . He also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared them as if they were from his personal experience . She would never hoping that the old man would leave him alone . ashamed and decide of his own accord to change benches . irritating . ” “ It ’ s a book that says the same thing almost all the other books in inability to choose their own Personal Legends . And it ends up saying that everyone believes the world ’ s greatest lie . ” surprised . That ’ s the world ’ s greatest lie . ” travel . ” want to return it at all . The boy noticed that the man ’ s clothing was parts . Africa was only a few hours from Tarifa ; one had only to cross shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day . “ Where are you from ? ” the boy asked . “ From many places . ” from a city near an ancient castle . That ’ s where I was born . ” fearing that he would appear ignorant . He looked at the people in seemed to be very busy . “ It ’ s like it always has been . ” No clue yet . But he knew that Salem wasn ’ t in Andalusia . If it “ And what do you do in Salem ? ” he insisted . king of Salem ! ” alone with one ’ s books . They tell their incredible stories at the time they say some things that are so strange that you don ’ t know how to continue the conversation . do you have ? ” know more about his life . you ’ ve got enough sheep . ” The boy was getting irritated . He wasn ’ t asking for help . It was the conversation . sheep and get going . ” you how to find the hidden treasure . ” old man — maybe he was her husband — was going to find a way to get much more money in exchange for information about something Something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded . With a movement that was too read what the old man had written in the sand . names of his father and his mother and the name of the seminary he awed and embarrassed . “ For several reasons . But let ’ s say that the most important is that you have succeeded in discovering your Personal Legend . ” The boy didn ’ t know what a person ’ s “ Personal Legend ” was . impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend . ” None of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy . But he wanted to know what the “ mysterious force ” was ; the merchant ’ s daughter would be impressed when he told her about that ! how to realize your Personal Legend . It prepares your spirit and universe . It ’ s your mission on earth . ” “ Even when all you want to do is travel ? Or marry the daughter of a textile merchant ? ” and jealousy . To realize one ’ s Personal Legend is a person ’ s only real obligation . All things are one . helping you to achieve it . ” townspeople . It was the old man who spoke first . “ Why do you tend a flock of sheep ? ” “ Because I like to travel . ” The old man pointed to a baker standing in his shop window at shepherds sleep out in the open . Parents would rather see their children marry bakers than shepherds . ” daughter . There was surely a baker in her town . about shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them than their own Personal Legends . ” as he himself had been interrupted . “ Why are you telling me all this ? ” “ Because you are trying to realize your Personal Legend . And you are at the point where you ’ re about to give it all up . ” “ And that ’ s when you always appear on the scene ? ” people don ’ t realize I ’ ve done them . ” had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds . For five years thousands of stones looking for an emerald . The miner was about to more stone — just one more — he would find his emerald . Since the decided to become involved . He transformed himself into a stone it aside . But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone beautiful emerald in the world . The boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure . flock . ” “ What about one-tenth of my treasure ? ” The old man looked disappointed . “ If you start out by promising toward getting it . ” The boy told him that he had already promised to give one-tenth of his treasure to the Gypsy . life has its price . This is what the Warriors of the Light try to teach . ” The old man returned the book to the boy . And I will tell you how to find the hidden treasure . Good afternoon . ” And he vanished around the corner of the plaza . man was right . He went over to the bakery and bought a loaf of the old man had said about him . Sometimes it ’ s better to leave the way things were . The boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the baker . So he began to wander through the he knew that Egypt was in Africa . “ Can I help you ? ” asked the man behind the window . strait . The idea frightened him . watching the boy walk away . “ He doesn ’ t have enough money to travel . ” years he had learned everything about shepherding : he knew how the sheep from wolves . He knew all the fields and pastures of Andalusia . And he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals . He decided to return to his friend ’ s stable by the longest route all of Spain . the plaza where he had talked with the old man . Curse the moment I a woman who could interpret his dream . Neither the woman nor the old man was at all impressed by the fact that he was a shepherd . and didn ’ t understand that shepherds become attached to their sheep . He knew everything about each member of his flock : he The wind began to pick up . He knew that wind : people called it the eastern end of the Mediterranean . something he had become accustomed to and something he wanted didn ’ t even remember him . He was sure that it made no difference recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises . to come and go from the baker ’ s shop . A young couple sat on the brought the smell of the desert and of veiled women . It had brought with it the sweat and the dreams of men who had once left to search that he could have the same freedom . There was nothing to hold the fields of Andalusia were only steps along the way to his Personal Legend . sheep with him . sheep immediately . He said that he had always dreamed of being a almost sure to win . Beginner ’ s luck . ” “ Why is that ? ” “ Because there is a force that wants you to realize your Personal Legend ; it whets your appetite with a taste of success . ” wool . “ Where is the treasure ? ” he asked . The boy was startled . The old woman had said the same thing . But she hadn ’ t charged him anything . God has prepared a path for everyone to follow . You just have to read the omens that he left for you . ” between him and the old man . He remembered something his grandfather had once told him : that butterflies were a good omen . clovers . “ Just as your grandfather taught you . These are good omens . ” precious stones . The boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day . He really was a king ! He must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves . black stone that had been embedded at the center of the breastplate . “ They are called Urim and Thummim . The black question . at the Pyramids ; that you already knew . But I had to insist on the payment of six sheep because I helped you to make your decision . ” make his own decisions . “ Don ’ t forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and don ’ t forget to follow your Personal Legend through to its conclusion . “ A certain shopkeeper sent his son to learn about the secret of happiness from the wisest man in the world . The lad wandered of the most delicious food in that part of the world . The wise man before it was his turn to be given the man ’ s attention . “ The wise man listened attentively to the boy ’ s explanation of explain the secret of happiness . He suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in two hours . to spill . ’ “ The boy began climbing and descending the many stairways of returned to the room where the wise man was . that are hanging in my dining hall ? Did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create ? Did you notice the beautiful parchments in my library ? ’ nothing . His only concern had been not to spill the oil that the wise man had entrusted to him . wise man . ‘ You cannot trust a man if you don ’ t know his house . ’ related in detail everything he had seen . “ ‘ But where are the drops of oil I entrusted to you ? ’ asked the wise man . gone . wisest of wise men . ‘ The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels The shepherd said nothing . He had understood the story the old never forget about his sheep . much change . All they wanted was food and water . Melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out seen Abraham again after having charged him his one-tenth fee . That was his work . Personal Legends . But the king of Salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful . thought . I should have repeated it for him . Then when he spoke sometimes has to take some pride in himself . ” He was sitting in a bar very much like the other bars he had seen along the narrow streets of Tangier . Some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other . In just a few chanted — as everyone about him went to their knees and placed their foreheads on the ground . had always looked at the image of Saint Santiago Matamoros on his kneeling at his feet . The boy felt ill and terribly alone . The infidels had an evil look about them . time : only Arabic was spoken in this country . drink that had been served at the next table . It turned out to be a bitter tea . The boy preferred wine . But he didn ’ t need to worry about that right now . What he had about getting it . The sale of his sheep had left him with enough man had known what he was talking about : during the time the boy which path he should take by observing the ground and the sky . He had discovered that the presence of a certain bird meant that a was water in the area . The sheep had taught him that . “ Who are you ? ” he heard a voice ask him in Spanish . someone had appeared . “ How come you speak Spanish ? ” he asked . The new arrival was a was from this city . He was about the same age and height as the boy . “ Almost everyone here speaks Spanish . We ’ re only two hours from Spain . ” ask for a glass of wine for me . I hate this tea . ” religion here forbids it . ” The boy told him then that he needed to get to the Pyramids . He payment for taking him there . He remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn ’ t even have yet . “ I ’ d like you to take me there if you can . I can pay you to serve as my guide . ” “ Do you have any idea how to get there ? ” the newcomer asked . listening attentively to their conversation . He felt uneasy at the out on an opportunity . enough . ” The boy thought it a strange question . But he trusted in the old universe always conspires in your favor . He took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young irritated . leave . ” grabbed him and began to speak to him in an angry stream of has its thieves . ” The boy trusted his new friend . He had helped him out in a dangerous situation . He took out his money and counted it . taking the money . “ But I have to buy two camels . ” They walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier . Everywhere there were stalls with items for sale . They reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held . There were that would be unfriendly . He knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in . than his friend . most beautiful sword he had ever seen . The scabbard was embossed to his friend . Then he realized that he had been distracted for a few he knew what he would find . He continued to look at the beautiful around . could he find his new companion . The boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident . He decided to stay right there and nearby tower and began his chant ; everyone in the market fell to stalls and left . houses surrounding the plaza . He recalled that when the sun had morning he had known everything that was going to happen to him where he couldn ’ t even speak the language . He was no longer a start everything over . could have changed so suddenly and so drastically . He was so ashamed that he wanted to cry . He had never even and because this was the way God repaid those who believed in their dreams . now I ’ m sad and alone . I ’ m going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me . I ’ m going to hate those who have found their treasure because I never found mine . And I ’ m conquer the world . He opened his pouch to see what was left of his possessions ; maybe there was a bit left of the sandwich he had eaten on the ship . the old man had given him . had exchanged six sheep for two precious stones that had been taken from a gold breastplate . He could sell the stones and buy a removing them from the pouch so he could put them in his pocket . him was that port towns are full of thieves . Now he understood why the owner of the bar had been so upset : he was trying to tell him not to trust that man . “ I ’ m like everyone not what actually does . ” temperature and feeling their surfaces . They were his treasure . Just handling them made him feel better . They reminded him of the old man . The boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man stones were proof that he had met with a king — a king who knew of the boy ’ s past . read the omens . ” The boy put the stones back in the pouch and decided to do an experiment . The old man had said to ask very clear he asked if the old man ’ s blessing was still with him . He took out one of the stones . It was “ yes . ” “ Am I going to find my treasure ? ” he asked . pouch and fell to the ground . The boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch . He knelt down to find Urim and Thummim and put them back in the pouch . But as he saw them lying said . An omen . The boy smiled to himself . He picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch . He didn ’ t consider mending the hole — the stones could fall through any time they wanted . He so as not to flee from one ’ s own Personal Legend . “ I promised that I and that made him feel more confident . He looked around at the strange place ; it was a new one . thought . Although his new world at the moment was just an empty and he would never forget it . He remembered the sword . It hurt him between thinking of himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an adventurer in quest of his treasure . HE WAS SHAKEN INTO WAKEFULNESS BY SOMEONE . HE had fallen asleep in resume . He no longer had to seek out food and water for the sheep ; he could as much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books . He walked slowly through the market . The merchants were reminded the boy of the old man — the mysterious old king he had met . “ This candy merchant isn ’ t making candy so that later he can travel or marry a shopkeeper ’ s daughter . He ’ s doing it because it ’ s the same thing the old man had done — sense whether a person was near to or far from his Personal Legend . Just by looking at them . It ’ s spoken Arabic and the other Spanish . And they had understood each other perfectly well . it ’ s happening with people . He was learning a lot of new things . Some of them were things had never perceived before . And he hadn ’ t perceived them because he had become accustomed to them . He realized : If I can learn to the world . the narrow streets of Tangier . Only in that way would he be able to his sheep . that he felt every morning . He had been in the same place for thirty years : a shop at the top of a hilly street where few customers passed . Now it was too late to change anything — the only thing he had ever learned to do was to buy and sell crystal glassware . There had been a time when many people knew of his shop : Arab were always well-heeled . In those days it had been wonderful to be have beautiful women at his side as he grew older . on the hill . And no one was going to climb the hill just to browse through a few small shops . But the crystal merchant had no choice . He had lived thirty years to do anything else . He spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings practiced eyes of the crystal merchant could see that the boy had no lunch for a few minutes until the boy moved on . A CARD HANGING IN THE DOORWAY ANNOUNCED THAT several languages were spoken in the shop . The boy saw a man appear behind the counter . them . ” The man looked at him without responding . entered the shop and bought some crystal . merchant . laughed . requires me to feed a hungry person . ” “ Because the crystal was dirty . And both you and I needed to cleanse our minds of negative thoughts . ” “ I ’ d like you to work in my shop . Two customers came in today really don ’ t know what they ’ re saying . Just as I hadn ’ t realized that for so many years I had been speaking a language without words to my sheep . “ Do you want to go to work for me ? ” the merchant asked . The merchant laughed . “ Even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year … even if you earned a good commission selling every are thousands of kilometers of desert between here and there . ” There was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the Pyramids . It was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy ’ s that moment . The merchant looked anxiously at the boy . All the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared . picked up his pouch . some sheep . ” PART TWO THE BOY HAD BEEN WORKING FOR THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT for almost a would make him happy . The merchant spent the entire day pieces and not to break anything . some money aside . That morning he had done some calculating : if whole year to be able to buy some sheep . who pass at the bottom of the hill . ” might have died if we had come upon a snake . But that ’ s the way life is with sheep and with shepherds . ” The merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses . He was selling better than ever … as if time had turned back to the old days when the street had been one of Tangier ’ s major attractions . return to your sheep . Why ask more out of life ? ” the merchant had never met the king . said . But the merchant understood what the boy had said . The boy ’ s having hired the boy . The boy was being paid more money than he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep . away from the business of the display . saying nothing about his dream . The treasure was now nothing but “ I don ’ t know anyone around here who would want to cross the pile of stones . You could build one in your backyard . ” wait on a customer who had entered the shop . him much . But we two have to live with our mistakes . ” “ Why did you think we should have the display ? ” “ I want to get back to my sheep faster . We have to take doing to help us . It ’ s called the principle of favorability . Or beginner ’ s luck . ” during our lives . The most important is to believe only in the one He stopped there . His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the wanted to live his life in accordance with Muslim law . “ What ’ s the fifth obligation ? ” the boy asked . merchant answered . “ The fifth obligation of every Muslim is a holy city of Mecca . “ Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids . When I was leave someone in charge of the shop ; the crystals are delicate things . pilgrimage were poorer than I . “ All who went there were happy at having done so . They placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses . One of tired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his leather . ” “ Because it ’ s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive . That ’ s on living . want to dream about Mecca . I ’ ve already imagined a thousand times seven times I walk around it before allowing myself to touch it . I ’ ve dream about it . ” display . Not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way . now able to speak their strange language . Since that morning in the because Egypt was now just as distant a dream for him as was disembark at Tarifa as a winner . words … and about omens . One afternoon he had seen a man at the “ Let ’ s sell tea to the people who climb the hill . ” “ But we could sell tea in crystal glasses . The people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses . I have been told that beauty is the great seducer of men . ” “ What is it you ’ re looking for ? ” asked the old merchant . earn the money to do so . ” deeply . and everything else there is to know about crystal . I know its is going to expand . And then I ’ ll have to change my way of life . ” that it hasn ’ t been too bad . The shop is exactly the size I always know how to deal with change . I ’ m used to the way I am . ” didn ’ t see before : every blessing ignored becomes a curse . I don ’ t want anything else in life . But you are forcing me to look at wealth worse than I did before you arrived . Because I know the things I thought the boy to himself . They went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to himself for being able to do so . There had been a time when he thought that his sheep could teach him everything he needed to know about the world . But they could never have taught him Arabic . There are probably other things in the world that the sheep can ’ t “ What does that mean ? ” answered . “ But in your language it would be something like ‘ It is written . ’ ” there ’ s just no way to hold back the river . the top . But there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing beautiful crystal glasses . would be impressed by the beauty of the glassware . The other man remarked that tea was always more delicious when it was served in tradition in the Orient to use crystal glasses for tea because it had magical powers . climb the hill to see the shop that was doing something new in a trade that was so old . Other shops were opened that served tea in business . and his shop was sought out by men and women with a thirst for things new . THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN . IT HAD BEEN ELEVEN months and nine days since he had first set foot on the African continent . especially for this day . He put his headcloth in place and secured it descended the stairs silently . The city was still sleeping . He prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass . Then he sat in the sun-filled sound of the wind that brought the scent of the desert . When he had It was a bundle of money . Enough to buy himself a hundred and Africa into his own country . He waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop . Then the two went off to have some more tea . my sheep . And you have the money you need to go to Mecca . ” The old man said nothing . “ Will you give me your blessing ? ” asked the boy . “ You have Then he turned to the boy . crystal shop . But you know that I ’ m not going to go to Mecca . Just as you know that you ’ re not going to buy your sheep . ” And he gave the boy his blessing . THE BOY WENT TO HIS ROOM AND PACKED HIS BELONGINGS . They filled three and Thummim . realize how long it had been since he had thought of him . For nearly aside enough money so that he could return to Spain with pride . omens . ” strange sensation that the old king was nearby . He had worked hard thought . Even though the sheep didn ’ t teach me to speak Arabic . But the sheep had taught him something even more important : language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying for something believed in and desired . Tangier was no longer a could conquer the world . dreams are but don ’ t want to realize them . The old king hadn ’ t told could build one in his backyard . And he had forgotten to mention The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things . He went down the stairs and found the merchant waiting on a foreign tea from crystal glasses . It was more activity than usual for this time the old merchant ’ s hair was very much like the hair of the old king . had also been like the old king ’ s smile . trying to realize their Personal Legend . He left without saying good-bye to the crystal merchant . He didn ’ t want to cry with the other people there . He was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned . He was more the world . longer happy with his decision . He had worked for an entire year to becoming less important . Maybe because that wasn ’ t really his dream . Who knows … maybe it ’ s better to be like the crystal merchant : boy thought — he came to the bar he had entered on his first day tea . done . But maybe I ’ ll never have another chance to get to the an entire desert between him and the Pyramids . Yet the boy felt that there was another way to regard his situation : he was actually two hours closer to his treasure … the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn ’ t matter . all the time I need . Why not ? He suddenly felt tremendously happy . He could always go back to being a shepherd . He could always become a crystal salesman anyone ! He was planning as he left the bar . He had remembered that one of the crystal merchant ’ s suppliers transported his crystal by means of caravans that crossed the desert . He held Urim and Thummim in to his treasure . What could it cost to go over to the supplier ’ s warehouse and find out if the Pyramids were really that far away ? THE ENGLISHMAN WAS SITTING ON A BENCH IN A STRUCTURE that smelled of and here I am in a corral . But he had to move on . He believed in omens . All his life and all his studies were aimed at finding the one true language of the but his studies had taken him to a point beyond which he could not seem to go . He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an Work — the Philosopher ’ s Stone — and for this reason kept their knowledge to themselves . He had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his had purchased all the rarest and most important volumes on alchemist had visited Europe . It was said that he was more than two Stone and the Elixir of Life . The Englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story . But he would never have thought it more archaeological expedition in the desert — told him about an Arab that was possessed of exceptional powers . transform any metal into gold . ” The Englishman could not contain his excitement . He canceled all his commitments and pulled together the most important of his thought . And the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable . greeted the Englishman . “ Where are you bound ? ” asked the young Arab . his reading . He didn ’ t want any conversation at this point . What he the alchemist would certainly put him to the test . The young Arab took out a book and began to read . The book other important things to do . burial scene that began the book . “ I ’ ve been trying for two years to concentrate . He still had some doubts about the decision he had made . But he was able to understand one thing : making a decision was only the diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision . a mystery to me . off the conversation . The boy closed his book . He felt that he didn ’ t want to do anything that might make him look like the Englishman . He took In a flash the boy put them back in his pocket . the earth . But those who know about such things would know that those are Urim and Thummim . I didn ’ t know that they had them in this part of the world . ” “ Did you say a king ? ” he asked . “ I guess you don ’ t believe that a king would talk to someone like “ Not at all . It was shepherds who were the first to recognize a surprising that kings would talk to shepherds . ” me about Urim and Thummim . These stones were the only form of divination permitted by God . The priests carried them in a golden breastplate . ” The boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse . “ Who told you about omens ? ” The boy ’ s interest was increasing by the moment . have to find a man who knows that universal language . An alchemist . ” The conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss . leaving today for Al-Fayoum . ” you ? ” about the words luck and coincidence . It ’ s with those words that the universal language is written . ” He told the boy it was no coincidence that he had met him with were in search of the alchemist . regretted having said it . But the Englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it . the warehouse boss called to them to come outside . hold the power of life and death for every person I take with me . crazy . ” belts and rifles slung on their shoulders . The Englishman had the leader had to repeat himself several times for everyone to understand what he was saying . will do everything possible once again to win out over the desert . But I want each and every one of you to swear by the God you believe in that you will follow my orders no matter what . In the There was a murmur from the crowd . Each was swearing quietly to his or her own God . The boy swore to Jesus Christ . The Englishman said nothing . And the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have . The people were also praying to heaven for protection . uncertainly onto their backs . The boy felt sorry for the Englishman ’ s picking up the conversation where it had been interrupted in the warehouse . “ I ’ m here because a friend of mine heard of an Arab who … ” what the Englishman was saying . The boy knew what he was about boy . The caravan moved toward the east . It traveled during the spent most of his time with his books . The boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert . Now everything was quite different from mixed with the nervous orders of the guides and the merchants . and of the hoofbeats of the animals . Even the guides spoke very little to one another . remain silent . ” seems old and wise . had sat at the fort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face . It reminded him of the wool from his sheep … his sheep who were always had . probably already forgotten me . That ’ s good . Creatures like the probably wasn ’ t the only one . But he was excited at his intuitive understanding of the camel driver ’ s comment : maybe he was also learning the universal language that deals with the past and the boy was beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden was covered with the salt of dried-up lakes . The animals balked at unburden their charges . The drivers carried the freight themselves appoint a new one . But all this happened for one basic reason : no matter how many his books . first few days of the journey . But he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind . As soon as he had a superstition that each time he opened the book he would learn He became friendly with the camel driver who traveled to the driver his adventures as a shepherd . and that made me feel good . never to me . My neighbors feared they would lose all their olive children . I thought that everything I owned would be destroyed . living . So now I ’ m a camel driver . But that disaster taught me to understand the word of Allah : people need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want . our possessions and property . But this fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand . ” something that the other needed — as if everything were indeed the desert . were Bedouins who did surveillance along the caravan route . They provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes . They came fire where the Englishman and the boy were sitting . “ There are The three fell silent . The boy noted that there was a sense of fear experiencing the language without words … the universal language . The Englishman asked if they were in danger . including the danger . ” And he concluded by saying the mysterious word : “ Maktub . ” Englishman . “ Books are like caravans in that respect . ” The immense collection of people and animals began to travel when the travelers were accustomed to talking around the fires — attract attention to the caravan . The travelers adopted the practice of arranging the animals in a the nocturnal cold . And the leader posted armed sentinels at the fringes of the group . The Englishman was unable to sleep one night . He called to the Englishman the story of his life . The Englishman was fascinated with the part about the progress achieved at the crystal shop after the boy began working there . World . It ’ s always a positive force . ” animal — or even just a simple thought . rarely recognize that it is working for us . But in the crystal shop you probably realized that even the glasses were collaborating in your success . ” The boy thought about that for a while as he looked at the moon and the bleached sands . “ I have watched the caravan as it crossed “ If either of us had joined this caravan based only on personal would have been much more difficult . ” They stood there looking at the moon . speaks to the soul of the desert . ” caravan . ” that seemed to repeat itself throughout all the books : all things are the manifestation of one thing only . In one of the books he learned that the most important text in inscribed on the surface of an emerald . might teach something to the boy . The book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists . They were men who had dedicated their entire lives to the purification of metals in their laboratories ; they believed World . This Soul of the World allowed them to understand anything things communicated . They called that discovery the Master Work — it was part liquid and part solid . “ Can ’ t you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language ? ” the boy asked . has to be followed exactly as it was followed by the masters . ” The boy learned that the liquid part of the Master Work was alchemist from growing old . And the solid part was called the Philosopher ’ s Stone . observing the fire that purified the metals . They spent so much time close to the fire that gradually they gave up the vanities of the world . They discovered that the purification of the metals had led to a purification of themselves . ” The boy thought about the crystal merchant . He had said that it could free himself from negative thoughts . The boy was becoming more and more convinced that alchemy could be learned in one ’ s daily life . fascinating property . A small sliver of the stone can transform large quantities of metal into gold . ” transform everything into gold . He read the lives of the various and Geber . They were fascinating stories : each of them lived out his Philosopher ’ s Stone and the Elixir of Life . But when the boy wanted to learn how to achieve the Master “ WHY DO THEY MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED ? ” HE asked the Englishman and missed his books . “ So that those who have the responsibility for understanding can transforming lead into gold . Gold would lose its value . middle of the desert . I ’ m seeking a true alchemist who will help me to decipher the codes . ” “ When were these books written ? ” the boy asked . “ Many centuries ago . ” argued . “ There was no way for everybody to know about alchemy . The Englishman didn ’ t answer him directly . He said that for the past few days he had been paying attention to how the caravan he had noticed was that talk of war was becoming more and more frequent . THEN ONE DAY THE BOY RETURNED THE BOOKS TO THE Englishman . “ Did might be . He needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war . understands that soul can also understand the language of things . I they could be written on the surface of an emerald . ” magic the strange and the laboratory equipment … none of this had made an impression on the boy . His He took back his books and packed them away again in their bags . and the sand raised by the animals . “ Everyone has his or her own THE CARAVAN BEGAN TO TRAVEL DAY AND NIGHT . THE hooded Bedouins had become a good friend of the boy ’ s — explained that the war between the tribes had already begun . The caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis . themselves less and less . The silence was the worst aspect of the because it might signal a raid . the threat of war . “ Because I don ’ t live in either my past or my future . I ’ m interested only in the present . If you can concentrate always on the looked for the star they followed every night . He thought that the stars on the desert itself . “ Because we have to sleep . ” early . But the boy was quiet . He was at home with the silence of the would just be a memory . But this was the present moment — the party the camel driver had mentioned — and he wanted to live it as he did the lessons of his past and his dreams of the future . Although could herald a miracle . as he watched the hundreds of people and animals arriving at the excitement at the arrival of the strangers . The alchemist saw the at length . But none of that mattered to the alchemist . He had already seen had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands . The dunes sands he had known since he was a child . He always enjoyed seeing Maybe God created the desert so that man could appreciate the date He decided to concentrate on more practical matters . He knew that in the caravan there was a man to whom he was to teach some of his secrets . The omens had told him so . He didn ’ t know the man He hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice . I don ’ t know why these things have to be transmitted by word of revealed his secrets easily to all his creatures . He had only one explanation for this fact : things have to be and this kind of life cannot be captured in pictures or words . wind up forgetting the Language of the World . being just a well surrounded by a few palm trees — as he had seen once in a geography book — was much larger than many towns back and innumerable colored tents spread among them . impatient to meet with the alchemist . animals and people that were arriving . The men of the oasis wanted with one another for access to the cloth and precious stones brought by the merchants . The silence of the desert was a distant world and found themselves once again in the world of people . They were relieved and happy . camel driver explained to the boy that oases were always inhabitants were women and children . There were oases leaving the oases as places of refuge . people together and gave them his instructions . The group was to remain there at the oasis until the conflict between the tribes was accommodations . That was the law of hospitality . Then he asked the men appointed by the tribal chieftains . may not shelter armies or troops . ” revolver out of his bag and gave it to the men who were collecting the arms . “ Why a revolver ? ” he asked . seemed as if what the old king had called “ beginner ’ s luck ” were no constantly subjected to tests of his persistence and courage . So he he would fail to see the signs and omens left by God along his path . God placed them along my path . He had surprised himself with job . He had never thought of them in terms of a language used by God to indicate what he should do . driver said : ‘ Eat when it ’ s time to eat . And move along when it ’ s time to move along . ’ ” tent with five other young men of about his age . They were people tell them of his experiences at the crystal shop when the Englishman came into the tent . outside . “ I need you to help me find out where the alchemist lives . ” probably live in a manner that was different from that of the rest of the oasis was much larger than they could have imagined ; there were hundreds of tents . sitting down with the boy near one of the wells . The Englishman didn ’ t want to tell others about his reasons for The boy approached a woman who had come to the well to fill a goatskin with water . alchemist lives here at the oasis . ” because they were married women . He should respect tradition . The Englishman was disappointed . It seemed he had made the long journey for nothing . The boy was also saddened ; his friend was that ’ s what the old king had said . He couldn ’ t have been wrong . The Englishman ’ s eyes lit up . “ That ’ s it ! Maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is ! Find out who it is who cures the people ’ s illnesses ! ” insistence . Then a man approached . “ Do you know someone here who cures people ’ s illnesses ? ” the boy asked . strangers . “ You ’ re looking for witch doctors . ” He spoke some verses bucket . The boy repeated his question . “ Why do you want to find that sort of person ? ” the Arab asked . “ Because my friend here has traveled for many months in order the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to . Only when he consents . “ Wait for the end of the war . Then leave with the caravan . Don ’ t But the Englishman was exultant . They were on the right track . ask about the alchemist . Soul of the World surged within him . When he looked into her dark he learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke — the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart . It was love . Something older than crystals and in the silence of the desert . It was the pure Language of the World . It required no endless time . What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in than of anything in the world . He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person before becoming committed . But maybe people who felt that way under the sun has been written by one hand only . It is the hand that the same . “ What ’ s your name ? ” he asked . “ That ’ s what some women in my country are called . ” invaders carried the name everywhere . ” The beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride . man who cured people ’ s illnesses . said . “ He communicates with the genies of the desert . ” The genies were the spirits of good and evil . And the girl pointed she filled her vessel with water and left . day in Tarifa the levanter had brought to him the perfume of that she existed . He knew that his love for her would enable him to discover every treasure in the world . asked me if I had ever transformed lead into gold . I told him that was what I had come here to learn . “ He told me I should try to do so . That ’ s all he said : ‘ Go and try . ’ ” The boy didn ’ t say anything . The poor Englishman had traveled already done so many times . “ That ’ s what I ’ m going to do . I ’ m going to start now . ” water . my wife . I love you . ” “ I ’ m going to wait here for you every day . I have crossed the it brought me to you . ” The boy looked around him at the date palms . He reminded shepherd again . Fatima was more important than his treasure . if she had guessed what he was thinking . “ And the women of the desert are proud of their tribesmen . ” She refilled her vessel and left . The boy went to the well every day to meet with Fatima . He told of the caravan called a meeting of all of the people traveling with him . important to both armies . It ’ s not a battle of good against evil . It ’ s a Allah is on both sides . ” went to meet with Fatima that afternoon . He told her about the become a part of you . ” more beautiful than the sound of the wind in the date palms . “ I have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time . I which men of the desert expect women to behave . Ever since I was a The boy wanted to take her hand . But Fatima ’ s hands held to the handles of her jug . it . “ That ’ s why I want you to continue toward your goal . If you have our love for each other . come back one day . ” The boy was sad as he left her that day . He thought of all the married shepherds he had known . They had a difficult time convincing their wives that they had to go off into distant fields . Love required them to stay with the people they loved . hide in the ravines and of the water that comes from the earth . They become a part of everything … they become the Soul of the World . “ Some do come back . And then the other women are happy too will be one of the women who wait . The boy went to look for the Englishman . He wanted to tell him about Fatima . He was surprised when he saw that the Englishman they had when he was reading his books . was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the Master But I ’ m happy at least that I didn ’ t wait twenty years . ” desert turned pink in the setting sun . He felt the urge to go out into to become hypnotized by the horizon . He tried to deal with the He watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind . Although sense to the boy . It was just that he couldn ’ t grasp what it meant . He it . Maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership . everything in the world is beginning to make sense to me … even the materialized over the sands of the desert . But he certainly didn ’ t desire that an army invade the oasis . meditation . He tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the that wouldn ’ t allow him to do so . to occur . dangerous . observing the sunset . He saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes . answered . But the boy told him about the hawks : that he had been watching their flight and had suddenly felt himself to have plunged to the Soul of the World . The camel driver understood what the boy was saying . He knew that any given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history means of penetration to the Soul of the World . The desert was full of men who earned their living based on the ease with which they could penetrate to the Soul of the World . They would be impossible to be effective in battle if one knew that he was thrill of not knowing what the outcome would be ; the future was of many things : Where was the enemy ’ s sword ? Where was his horse ? What kind of blow should one deliver next in order to consulted with seers . Many of them had been right about what they had ever sought out ( and the one most to be feared ) had asked why the camel driver was so interested in the future . change those things that I don ’ t want to happen . ” said . myself for what ’ s coming . ” greatly before they even occur . ” driver had said to the seer . “ And men always live their lives based on the future . ” The seer was a specialist in the casting of twigs ; he threw them cloth and put them back in his bag . omens that are here in the present . guess at the future ? Based on the omens of the present . The secret is The camel driver had asked what the circumstances were under which God would allow him to see the future . that was written so as to be altered . ” thought . Why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument ? “ Tell them about the armies that are approaching . ” “ They ’ ll laugh at me . ” to dealing with omens . ” “ They ’ re not concerned with that right now . They believe that if someone will tell them about it . It has happened many times before . The boy thought of Fatima . And he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes . THE BOY APPROACHED THE GUARD AT THE FRONT OF THE huge white tent at the center of the oasis . “ I want to see the chieftains . I ’ ve brought omens from the desert . ” into the tent . conversation with her . boy was astonished by what he saw inside . Never could he have like this one . The ground was covered with the most beautiful resting upon richly embroidered silk cushions . Servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea . Other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs . The atmosphere was suffused with the sweet scent of smoke . which of them was the most important : an Arab dressed in white young Arab the boy had spoken with earlier . “ Who is this stranger who speaks of omens ? ” asked one of the knows that we have been here for generations ? ” said another of the chieftains . said . “ I can see things that eyes habituated to the desert might not see . ” to himself . third chieftain . you don ’ t have to do anything about it . ” The men fell into an animated discussion . They spoke in an told him that something was wrong . He regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert . and the boy felt better . The man hadn ’ t participated in the feel the vibrations of peace throughout the tent . Now his intuition was that he had been right in coming . The discussion ended . The chieftains were silent for a few moments as they listened to what the old man was saying . Then he turned to the boy : this time his expression was cold and distant . know that whoever believes in dreams also knows how to interpret them . ” “ We always observe the Tradition . The Tradition saved Egypt how their children should marry . The Tradition says that an oasis is vulnerable . ” No one said a word as the old man continued . “ But the Tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert . Everything we know was taught to us by the desert . ” again : no one at the oasis may carry arms . Throughout the entire day we will once again surrender their arms to me . For every ten dead men “ But arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle . Arms time they might not function . If at least one of them hasn ’ t been began to make his way there . He was alarmed by what had happened . He had succeeded in having done so might be his life . It was a frightening bet . But he had been making risky bets ever since the day he had sold his sheep to die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day . Every day was there to be lived or to mark one ’ s departure from this world . Everything depended on one word : “ Maktub . ” silence of the desert and Fatima ’ s eyes . He had lived every one of his days intensely since he had left home so long ago . If he died and he was proud of that . the ground by a wind such as he had never known . The area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view . Before frightening scream . what he saw . Astride the animal was a horseman dressed with a black kerchief . He appeared to be a messenger from the mere messenger . scabbard mounted on his saddle . The steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon . “ Who dares to read the meaning of the flight of the hawks ? ” he fifty thousand palm trees of Al-Fayoum . except that now the roles were reversed . I was able to see through to the Soul of the World . ” until the point touched the boy ’ s forehead . It drew a droplet of blood . sense of joy : he was about to die in pursuit of his Personal Legend . that Soul . The stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy ’ s forehead . “ Why did you read the flight of the birds ? ” “ I read only what the birds wanted to tell me . They wanted to men at the oasis than you have . ” The sword remained where it was . “ Who are you to change what Allah has willed ? ” taught me the language of the birds . Everything has been written by words . the boy felt immensely relieved . But he still couldn ’ t flee . of the battle . ” The stranger seemed satisfied with the answer . But he kept the sword in his hand . “ What is a stranger doing in a strange land ? ” “ I am following my Personal Legend . It ’ s not something you would understand . ” relaxed . quality most essential to understanding the Language of the World . ” The boy was surprised . The stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about . those who become distracted . ” What he said reminded the boy of the old king . The same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip . away . The hand with the whip pointed to the south . The boy had met the alchemist . throughout the palm trees at Al-Fayoum . Before the sun had horizon . The mounted troops entered the oasis from the north ; it hidden in their robes . When they reached the white tent at the they attacked an empty tent . The men of the oasis surrounded the horsemen from the desert and within half an hour all but one of the intruders were dead . The and saw nothing of what had happened . The women had remained The only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion . asked him why he had violated the Tradition . The commander said return to the war . that the Tradition was sacred . He condemned the commander to desert wind . asked the boy to become the counselor of the oasis . and a group of Arabs passing by told the boy that it was a place inhabited by genies . But the boy sat down and waited . Not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view . He carried two dead hawks over his shoulder . Personal Legend that brings you here ? ” desert . So I have come here . ” boy should enter the tent with him . It was a tent like many at the oasis . The boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus mysterious designs . said the alchemist . The boy suspected that they were the same hawks he had seen scent of the hookahs . “ Why did you want to see me ? ” the boy asked . Englishman . He ’ s the one that ’ s looking for you . ” “ He has other things to do first . But he ’ s on the right track . He has begun to try to understand the desert . ” “ And what about me ? ” Another person was there to help him toward his Personal Legend . “ So you are going to instruct me ? ” “ No . You already know all you need to know . I am only going to point you in the direction of your treasure . ” “ I know what ’ s happening in the desert . ” “ I also have Fatima . She is a treasure greater than anything else I have won . ” They ate in silence . The alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy ’ s cup . It was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted . “ Isn ’ t wine prohibited here ? ” the boy asked alchemist . “ It ’ s what comes out of their mouths that is . ” under a moon so brilliant that it made the stars pale . everything you have learned along the way can make sense . traitorous : they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire . they are about to die . ” where there is life out in the desert . Only those who can see such signs of life are able to find treasure . ” thought . I don ’ t know the desert that well yet . man . They reached the rocky place where the boy had seen the And then the boy understood . He loosened the reins on his followed as the boy ’ s horse ran for almost half an hour . They could no longer see the palms of the oasis — only the gigantic moon above alchemist ’ s eyes — the boy could see only his eyes — squinted with his effort . His arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the minutes . with the snakes of the desert . The boy watched as his companion went to his horse and then he placed the snake within it . The serpent relaxed immediately . “ Why was that so important ? ” “ Because the Pyramids are surrounded by the desert . ” The boy didn ’ t want to talk about the Pyramids . His heart was continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon Fatima . treasure . ” knows that men have to go away in order to return . And she already has her treasure : it ’ s you . Now she expects that you will find what it is you ’ re looking for . ” “ Let me tell you what will happen . You ’ ll be the counselor of the oasis . You have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels . how the world is always changing . And you ’ ll get better and better there is . try to ignore them . You ’ ll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants . The tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do . And your camels will bring you wealth and power . she ’ ll return your love . You ’ ll remember that she never asked you to man . So you won ’ t blame her . But many times you ’ ll walk the sands could have trusted more in your love for Fatima . Because what kept you at the oasis was your own fear that you might never come back . forever . and a great deal of merchandise . You ’ ll spend the rest of your days it ’ s too late . “ You must understand that love never keeps a man from because it wasn ’ t true love … the love that speaks the Language of the World . ” slithered away among the rocks . The boy remembered the crystal Englishman in search of the alchemist . He thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert . And he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved . followed the alchemist back to the oasis . The wind brought the strange horseman with the falcon on his shoulder had spoken of Legend . in his heart . response . friend enough gold to buy a sheep . Then he asked his friend to go into the tent where Fatima was buy yet another sheep . sheep . Fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent . The two walked out among the palms . The boy knew that it was a violation of the coming back . I love you because … ” one is loved . No reason is needed for loving . ” the entire universe conspired to help me find you . ” The two embraced . It was the first time either had touched the other . then . ” They said nothing else . They walked a bit farther among the said . He saw that Fatima ’ s eyes were filled with tears . “ You ’ re crying ? ” out to do the chores she had done for years . But everything had never again have the same meaning it had had only yesterday . It would no longer be a place with fifty thousand palm trees and three place for her . boy was following in search of his treasure . She would have to send the hope for his return . the boy as they began to ride across the sands of the desert . forever . ” boy said . He was already reaccustomed to the desert ’ s silence . one can always come back . If what you had found was only a on your return . ” The man was speaking the language of alchemy . But the boy knew that he was referring to Fatima . It was difficult not to think about what he had left behind . The camel driver who was a teacher without realizing it . Maybe the speaking only of the precautions they needed to follow in order to failed to observe . offered his water container to the boy . “ I congratulate you for having pursued your Personal Legend . ” thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know . A alchemy . But I wasn ’ t able to learn anything from them . ” through action . Everything you need to know you have learned through your journey . You need to learn only one thing more . ” “ Why are you called the alchemist ? ” “ Because that ’ s what I am . ” “ And what went wrong when other alchemists tried to make gold and were unable to do so ? ” wanting actually to live out the Personal Legend . ” “ What is it that I still need to know ? ” the boy asked . But the alchemist continued to look to the horizon . And finally the falcon returned with their meal . They dug a hole and lit their fire feel that they knew a better way than others had . Yet the Emerald Tablet is still alive today . ” “ What was written on the Emerald Tablet ? ” the boy wanted to know . as if it had taken place years and years ago . The boy tried to read what was written in the sand . saw in the Englishman ’ s books . ” hawks ; it can ’ t be understood by reason alone . The Emerald Tablet is a direct passage to the Soul of the World . “ The wise men understood that this natural world is only an image and a copy of paradise . The existence of this world is simply a guarantee that there exists a world that is perfect . God created the spiritual teachings and the marvels of his wisdom . That ’ s what I mean by action . ” “ Should I understand the Emerald Tablet ? ” the boy asked . the right time to study the best way to understand the Emerald Tablet . But you are in the desert . So immerse yourself in it . The on the face of the earth will do that . You don ’ t even have to understand the desert : all you have to do is contemplate a simple “ How do I immerse myself in the desert ? ” THEY CROSSED THE DESERT FOR ANOTHER TWO DAYS IN silence . The approaching the area where the most violent battles were being times it became so emotional over the desert sunrise that the boy had to hide his tears . His heart beat fastest when it spoke to the boy when the boy and the alchemist had fallen into silence . they had made camp that day . treasure . ” when I ’ m thinking about her . ” has to say . ” boy ’ s heart began to speak of fear . It told him stories it had heard treasure and never succeeded . Sometimes it frightened the boy with satisfied : it had found love and riches . had paused to rest the horses . “ It doesn ’ t want me to go on . ” you ’ ve won . ” “ Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet . Even if and about the world . ” “ Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly . If you know your “ You will never be able to escape from your heart . So it ’ s better unanticipated blow . ” The boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the suffer terribly . ” alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky . “ Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself . And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in second ’ s encounter with God and with eternity . ” was a part of the dream that I would find it . When I have been truly I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that seemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve . ” things that came from the Soul of the World . It said that all people who are happy have God within them . And that happiness could be has taken millions of years to create it . “ Everyone on earth has a want to go in search of them . We speak of them only to children . we don ’ t want people to suffer because they don ’ t follow their hearts . ” “ Why don ’ t people ’ s hearts tell them to continue to follow their dreams ? ” the boy asked the alchemist . like to suffer . ” message . understood that the boy ’ s heart had returned to the Soul of the World . “ So what should I do now ? ” the boy asked . “ And continue to pay heed to the omens . Your heart is still capable of showing you where the treasure is . ” “ Is that the one thing I still needed to know ? ” everything that was learned along the way . It does this not because master the lessons we ’ ve learned as we ’ ve moved toward that dream . That ’ s the point at which most people give up . It ’ s the point just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon . ’ “ Every search begins with beginner ’ s luck . And every search ends with the victor ’ s being severely tested . ” The boy remembered an old proverb from his country . It said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn . the alchemist were doing there . “ We ’ re going to have to search you to see whether you ’ re had searched the boy ’ s bag . The tribesman who was searching the alchemist ’ s belongings that was slightly larger than a chicken ’ s egg . “ What are these things ? ” he asked . “ That ’ s the Philosopher ’ s Stone and the Elixir of Life . It ’ s the Master Work of the alchemists . Whoever swallows that elixir will into gold . ” alchemist to proceed with all of their belongings . moved on . “ What did you do that for ? ” the boy ’ s heart became more and more silent . It no longer wanted to know about things of the past or future ; it was content simply to was capable now of betraying the other . the desert were wearisome . His heart told the boy what his strongest qualities were : his courage in having given up his sheep during the time he had worked at the crystal shop . And his heart told him something else that the boy had never he had never perceived . His heart said that one time it had hidden that the boy might wound himself . And it reminded the boy of the he had fallen into a deep sleep . There had been two thieves farther ahead who were planning to steal the boy ’ s sheep and murder him . thinking that he had changed his route . “ Does a man ’ s heart always help him ? ” the boy asked the alchemist . “ Mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their “ Does that mean that I ’ ll never run into danger ? ” said . tribes . At each corner of the camp were Arabs garbed in beautiful hookahs and trading stories from the battlefield . No one paid any attention to the two travelers . the encampment . forget that you ’ re in the desert . When men are at war with one one fails to suffer the consequences of everything under the sun . ” appeared from behind the travelers . where the tribes are at war . ” straight into the eyes of the horsemen . They were silent for a move along . The boy watched the exchange with fascination . “ You dominated alchemist . been one who stared fixedly at the two . He had been so far away that his face wasn ’ t even visible . But the boy was certain that he had been looking at them . only two days from the Pyramids . teach me about alchemy . ” “ You already know about alchemy . It is about penetrating to the reserved for you . ” into gold . ” only after they had stopped to eat . don ’ t know why . I just know that the Tradition is always right . conflict . ” But then he stopped . The alchemist probably already knew all that . thing evolves as well . “ Others stumbled upon the stone by accident . They already had of others . But they don ’ t count . They ’ re quite rare . iron have their own Personal Legends to fulfill . And anyone who interferes with the Personal Legend of another thing never will discover his own . ” The alchemist ’ s words echoed out like a curse . He reached over and picked up a shell from the ground . The alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear . He had of the sea . Legend . And it will never cease doing so until the desert is once again covered by water . ” Pyramids of Egypt . THE SUN WAS SETTING WHEN THE BOY ’ S HEART SOUNDED a danger signal . alchemist to see whether he had sensed anything . But he appeared horsemen waiting ahead of them . Before he could say anything to hundred . And then they were everywhere in the dunes . surrounding their turbans . Their faces were hidden behind blue souls . And their eyes spoke of death . THE TWO WERE TAKEN TO A NEARBY MILITARY CAMP . A soldier shoved the boy and the alchemist into a tent where the chief was holding a meeting with his staff . “ You were seen at the enemy camp three days ago . And you were talking with one of the troops there . ” said the alchemist . “ I have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes . I was simply acting as a guide for my friend here . ” “ Who is your friend ? ” the chief asked . nature . And he wants to show you his extraordinary powers . ” The boy listened quietly . And fearfully . “ What is a foreigner doing here ? ” asked another of the men . alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief . The Arab accepted them without a word . There was enough there to buy a lot of weapons . “ It ’ s a man who understands nature and the world . If he wanted knew that the wind could not deliver them a fatal blow . Yet each felt were fearful of sorcerers . tribe . ” of the tent . But the boy couldn ’ t even speak . He was able to do so only after they had walked through the center of the camp . There was no need an impenetrable wall . “ You gave them everything I had ! ” the boy said . “ Everything I ’ ve saved in my entire life ! ” alchemist answered . “ Your money saved us for three days . It ’ s not often that money saves a person ’ s life . ” But the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom . He had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind . He wasn ’ t an alchemist ! alchemist muttered some words that the boy didn ’ t understand . “ But I have no idea how to turn myself into the wind . ” everything he needs to know . There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve : the fear of failure . ” “ I ’ m not afraid of failing . It ’ s just that I don ’ t know how to turn myself into the wind . ” “ But what if I can ’ t ? ” “ Then you ’ ll die in the midst of trying to realize your Personal who never even knew what their Personal Legends were . of death makes people a lot more aware of their lives . ” number of wounded were brought back to the camp . The dead of his companions . “ You could have died after peace had been who had taken his falcon out into the desert . repeated . “ Remember what I told you : the world is only the visible aspect of God . And that what alchemy does is to bring spiritual perfection into contact with the material plane . ” “ What are you doing ? ” “ Feeding my falcon . ” the boy said . “ Why feed your falcon ? ” know how to turn myself into the wind . ” camp . The sentinels allowed him to go ; they had already heard He spent the entire afternoon of the second day looking out over sensed his fear . They both spoke the same language . himself into the wind . ” The boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day . He told them all to be seated . desert . ” The boy looked out at the horizon . There were mountains in the living where survival seemed impossible . There was the desert that palm trees and three hundred wells . “ What do you want here today ? ” the desert asked him . “ Didn ’ t you spend enough time looking at me yesterday ? ” the wind . ” “ What is love ? ” the desert asked . generous to him . ” answered . “ To nourish the falcon . And the falcon then nourishes will once again flourish . That ’ s how the world goes . ” “ So is that what love is ? ” “ But you can at least understand that somewhere in your sands there is a woman waiting for me . And that ’ s why I have to turn myself into the wind . ” The desert didn ’ t answer him for a few moments . wind . ” A breeze began to blow . The tribesmen watched the boy from a couldn ’ t understand . The alchemist smiled . The wind approached the boy and touched his face . It knew of to die . loved one to me . ” “ Who taught you to speak the language of the desert and the wind ? ” things . ” I love . ” “ I heard what you were talking about the other day with the Personal Legend . But people can ’ t turn themselves into the wind . ” “ So you and I can talk about the limitless possibilities of people and the winds . ” know how to turn a man into the wind . And look how many things that there were other things the wind should be able to do . wind . And it knew nothing about love . having to acknowledge its own limitations . “ Maybe it ’ s better to ask heaven . ” sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun . Then I can look to heaven without blinding myself . ” sand . The sun was turned into a golden disk . desert were already familiar with that wind . They called it the and all their weapons were filled with sand . They could barely see the boy . Their faces were covered with the “ I want to see how a man turns himself into the wind . ” But he made a mental note of the names of the two men who had are not afraid . grow and the sheep to seek out shade . From where I am — and I ’ m a long way from the earth — I learned how to love . I know that if I and the Soul of the World would no longer exist . So we contemplate and it gives me my reason for living . ” great length to each other during this endless trip through the only the minerals and vegetables understand that all things are one . the same as gold . Each performs its own exact function as a unique that wrote all this had stopped on the fifth day of creation . the boy said . “ But you don ’ t know about love . If there hadn ’ t been a but one day that Personal Legend will be realized . So each thing has thing only . ” was in his former life . Lead will play its role until the world has no further need for lead ; and then lead will have to turn itself into gold . too . ” asked the boy . roam the world like the wind . And it ’ s not love to see everything become better or worse . And that ’ s where the power of love comes we are . ” “ So what do you want of me ? ” the sun asked . answered . “ But I don ’ t know how to turn you into the wind . ” and wanted to tell every corner of the world that the sun ’ s wisdom had its limitations . That it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the Language of the World . each other as they sought to keep from being blown away . speak . prayer without words or pleas . His prayer didn ’ t give thanks for his sheep having found new pastures ; it didn ’ t ask that the boy be able to sell more crystal ; and it didn ’ t beseech that the woman he had single emerald . He saw that omens were scattered throughout the man into the wind . Because only the hand understood that it was a larger design that had moved the universe to the point at which six days of creation had evolved into a Master Work . it was a part of the Soul of God . And he saw that the Soul of God was THE SIMUM BLEW THAT DAY AS IT HAD NEVER BLOWN before . For where the boy had been . But he was no longer there ; he was camp . The men were terrified at his sorcery . But there were two the glory of God . them as far as they chose . the escorts they could return to the camp . only three hours from the Pyramids . ” World . ” “ I only invoked what you already knew . ” The alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery . A monk dressed in black came to the gates . They spoke for a few minutes in smiled . They went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery . The which the alchemist placed in an iron pan . When the lead had and added it to the pan in which the lead had melted . The monk was irritated . The caravans had been stopped at Giza the monk said . longer lead . It was gold . “ Will I learn to do that someday ? ” the boy asked . answered . “ But I wanted to show you that it was possible . ” alchemist separated the disk into four parts . monk . “ It ’ s for your generosity to the pilgrims . ” responded . the next time . ” The alchemist turned to the boy . “ This is for you . To make up for what you gave to the general . ” The boy was about to say that it was much more than he had alchemist said to the monk . He took the fourth part and handed it to the monk . “ This is for the boy . If he ever needs it . ” close to it now . ” “ Then why this ? ” “ Because you have already lost your savings twice . Once to the happens once can never happen again . But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time . ’ ” They mounted their horses . The boy brought his horse closer . sent to the most distant regions of the empire . The other son was a and told him that the words of one of his sons would be learned and repeated throughout the world for all generations to come . The proud to know . who was about to be crushed by the wheels of a chariot . Since he in his dream . any wish you desire . ’ son ’ s poems will be read by men for generations to come . I don ’ t want anything for myself . But any father would be proud of the to see my son ’ s words . ’ surrounded by thousands of people speaking a strange language . “ The man wept with happiness . angel through his tears . ‘ Can you please tell me which of my son ’ s poems these people are repeating ? ’ “ ‘ The verses of your son who was the poet were very popular in words you ’ re hearing now are those of your son in the military . ’ “ The man looked at the angel in surprise . he was seeking was the Son of God . He met others who had been where the man he was looking for was visiting . ’ rabbi made ready to go to his house with him . But the centurion was he was surely in the presence of the Son of God . ’ under my roof . But only speak a word and my servant will be healed . ” ” ’ earth plays a central role in the history of the world . And normally he doesn ’ t know it . ” The boy smiled . He had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd . avidly to what his heart had to say . It was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden . alchemist had told him . story of a shepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had many men who had wandered in search of distant lands or beautiful change . “ Be aware of the place where you are brought to tears . That ’ s where The boy climbed the dune slowly . A full moon rose again in the starry sky : it had been a month since he had set forth from the oasis . appearance of a rolling sea ; it reminded the boy of the day when journey in search of treasure . illuminated by the light of the moon and the brightness of the The boy fell to his knees and wept . He thanked God for making for his having met a woman of the desert who had told him that love would never keep a man from his Personal Legend . He didn ’ t need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone . The everything he might have dreamed of . reminded himself that no project is completed until its objective has he thought of what the crystal merchant had once said : that anyone could build a pyramid in his backyard . The boy could see now that he couldn ’ t do so if he placed stone upon stone for the rest of his life . but found nothing . He felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the Pyramids had been built . But he didn ’ t stop . He struggled sand back into the excavation . His hands were abraded and his tears fell . heard footsteps . Several figures approached him . Their backs were faces . “ What are you doing here ? ” one of the figures demanded . other figure said . “ What are you hiding there ? ” But one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the gold . in the man ’ s eyes the boy saw death . “ He ’ s probably got more gold hidden in the ground . ” near . “ What good is money to you if you ’ re going to die ? It ’ s not often that he had twice dreamed of a treasure hidden near the Pyramids of Egypt . The man who appeared to be the leader of the group spoke to one of the others : “ Leave him . He doesn ’ t have anything else . He must have stolen this gold . ” look for a ruined church where shepherds and their sheep slept . In would find a hidden treasure . But I ’ m not so stupid as to cross an entire desert just because of a recurrent dream . ” And they disappeared . heart bursting with joy . Because now he knew where his treasure was . EPILOGUE could still be seen through the half-destroyed roof . He remembered the time he had been there with his sheep ; it had been a peaceful night … except for the dream . He sat looking at the sky for a long time . Then he took from his looked at the stars and drank wine together . He thought of the many show him his treasure . If he hadn ’ t believed in the significance of himself . began to dig at the base of the sycamore . whole story . You even left a bit of gold at the monastery so I could get back to this church . The monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters . Couldn ’ t you have saved me from that ? ” with jewels . The spoils of a conquest that the country had long ago about . The boy took out Urim and Thummim from his bag . He had used marketplace . His life and his path had always provided him with enough omens . He placed Urim and Thummim in the chest . They were also a It ’ s true ; life really is generous to those who pursue their to get to Tarifa so he could give one-tenth of his treasure to the he thought . Maybe it was because they moved around so much . The boy smiled . It was the first time she had done that . ABOUT THE AUTHOR he now lives .
